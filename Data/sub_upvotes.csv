I just pulled two cars out of a sand pit and they told me they had been waving at cars trying to get someone to stop for a whole friggin hour. Their A/C had nearly given up and one lady was close to fainting and clearly dehydrated. 

May I remind you that it is possible to [die of dehydration in a matter of hours in this heat](http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/tributes-to-rally-driver-who-died-of-dehydration-in-uae-desert).

Even if you don't have a 4x4 there are other ways you can help, maybe water, maybe your A/C, maybe ferrying someone to a petrol station and in any case you can't know what is their emergency before you stop.

Now nothing was stolen, I don't have much at home in general but all in all nothing was taken .. ipad was there, watches, phones..etc.

I didn't call the police because :
1- Nothing was stolen, so maybe no point for the hassle.
2- I do have alcohol at home, and get girlfriend and random working girls visiting me from time to time, and last thing I need is some fines because of alcohol with no license or questioning why my girlfriend spends nights here .etc 

I have informed the building security, and they checked, unfortunately there is no camera in the corridor, I found workers in the flat next to mine.

Any tips or advice?

I am a fresh graduate who had to come back here because my parents were unwell. Honestly, I did not have the monetary ability to pursue higher education in USA/UK/Canada/Australia (or the rest of Europe) - at least not without racking up some serious debt. I did, however, study in respected universities in my own country. Universities that I gained admission in to by beating thousands of people. Universities in a country where the education is unfortunately perceived as inferior. However, my curriculum was framed by the American body that governs the field and the material was licensed from Harvard Business School (and taught by professors who were trained there). Universities I graduated from with top grades.

Here, though, I am unemployable. If there is *anyone* here who has a say in the hiring process, please consider the fact that some of us can't help where we were born and how deep our pockets are.

Second attempt also failed despite an elaborate scheme by the agency to have her brought through Bangkok on two separate flights, but they also didn't let her. Again, tickets went to waste and agency fees too.

Well, I've lived here all my life... and have recently started working, I've had relationships during my younger years, but things have started to become really empty the last 3-4 years... I am feeling really lonely, all though I am doing great in my career, progressing & all that... I feel like there is this emptiness in my heart that I just can't fill.... I want to have someone I can talk to at the end of the day, someone to hold, someone to cuddle and feel good about my life... 




I feel like I am just following a mundane routine every single day with nothing interesting happening, Wake up - go to work - get back - eat & sleep.... its really starting to make me feel depressed, I'd really like to give it a shot and meet someone to add to my life & feel happiness... and maybe I'll be able to give them happiness back too and fulfillment in their lives, it feels really hard to meet anyone here... everyone seems so distant and un-approachable.... sure I have friends, but we just meet up once a month or so, have a few drinks and go our separate ways again. I want to feel intimacy, be able to talk about everything & anything... be able to support them & also be supported back, I want to love.... 




I want to meet someone who I can talk with about anything & can do the same back for them, and get lost in intelligent conversations all night, I am a serious relationship type of guy.. I want to pour my heart out to my partner and be a open book.. I love knowing the little things that make her smile, the little things that give her that shiver up her spine.... I want that, I want to hold her tight in my arms and tell her she matters... 




I don't want to be alone anymore, I love this city but I want someone to share my life with, this place is so depressing being alone....  I am a very kind, gently and down to earth person... I get excited when I receive cute texts from her, meeting up for lunches and seeing her beautiful smile to help me de-stress from work... holding her hand and telling her everything is going to be ok.... 




I am looking for that special someone! would there be any single ladies on r/dubai who is looking for the same... wanting to have someone special in their life & enjoy their life to the fullest as they navigate this isolated lonely desert city?... if so, I would really like to talk to you & get to know you, please PM me and we can see where it goes :) ~

40,submission,59xz2t,2016-10-29 04:32:39,"For anybody who hasn't travelled Emirates recently. FYI & TLDR: Emirates are now *enforcing* luggage allowance and an absolute maximum 7kg carry on allowance by making you throw stuff away as well as being much stricter and providing a greatly reduced level of customer service. 

I travelled to the UK from Dubai this morning with a 30kg luggage (weighed on my home scale) that was apparently 33kg at check in and I had to literally ditch belongings into the bin until I could fly, and the girl also made me weigh my carry on for the first time, from which I had to ditch 6kg. I've never heard of a carry on limitation before. They normally don't bother weighing my carry on at all and I fly with the same 'office load' of my essential electronics, personal effects and a change of clothes every time recently. 
After spending almost an hour in the check in queue (because Emirates were running all their check in desks through just two queues, with no usher, (quick sums in my head calculates that that lead to an extra 20 mins waiting time per person on average.)) and my only clue about the 7kg limit being a sign at the check in desk, by which time I had no way to do anything about it. I was told that I had 8 minutes to bin 9kg of weight. 
(This happened to a lot of people, there were lots of delays not in that previous calculation due to people being forced to bin possessions)

This very much put me on the spot, as she effectively threatened to deny me access to the plane unless I sorted it in the next 4 minutes. 

I binned some clothes, a towel, my old laptop the amp for my speakers and a few other things that were eventually replaceable. She then pointed me toward the next gate and customs check in. 

Here there was another (new) desk with a girl weighing carry on. 
Having confidentially now passed the previous weigh in I dropped my ruck on the scale and it measured 8kg, she said I must throw away a further 1kg before I'm allowed in the plane. 
This girl was a complete jobsworth, no professionalism tact or responsibility, completely out of her league trying to deal directly with guests. 
I took my remaining (work) laptop out of my bag and asked her to reweigh it, at this point I was running late for my plane despite getting to the airport over 2 hours in advance of boarding. 
She refused, pointed me to the back of the line, which was apparently for everybody trying to get to security and would have caused me to miss my plane and lose my luggage. 
I told her she was an utter jobsworth, apologised to the next person in the line, who was very understanding, and I reweighed my bag at 6kg. I asked her if she was going to make me throw away my laptop. After sputtering a little she caved and said no, so I ran for security and then to my gate. 

If they are going to start strictly enforcing such rules then they also need to start making that information much more readily available in order to make sure that the hundreds of people who struggled and lost their possessions today don't have any issues. I know it's difficult to advertise, but spreading awareness would have been much more effective than just penalising their paying customers. 
I asked how much the excess would cost me, they said 3,400. That is kg for kg far more expensive than it costs to ship me in the first place.

45,submission,5j59bn,2016-12-19 11:58:36,"Tailgating is bullying, and must be treated as a crime, here's why. When driving on a highway within the speed limit and someone sticks the nose of their car to the back of your car, this means few things:

1- The person behind is harassing you for no reason
2- He's putting his life AND yours in danger, in case you had to stop the car suddenly. If you think carefully about it, it's like a murder attempt!
3- He might be harassing you for a reason, such as he feels superior to you (racism)

**So how to deal with such people?**

Personally, I won't gamble with my life in such situations. I always give way, because stupid decisions might end someone's life.

This subreddit is becoming more foolish as it continues growing. It used to be about discussions on local issues and news or awareness to others, but recently, more topics are made by people making fun of religion and the arabic culture as well as the local one. The mods should be more vigilant about such posts that promote hatred and useless arguments. This country respects all religions and we expect everyone to treat others fairly, shouldn't this sub also reflect that? You don't see posts here from arabs and locals hating on other religions or ethnicity, especially something like this: https://i.imgur.com/1upR0iN.png    
   
   
Yesterday's post was an eye-opener tbh, I reported the crap out of it but action was taken after so many hours where so many pointless arguments were already underway and hatred promoted. Such threads should be cleaned out earlier before it grows imo.   
  
    
I understand mods are just humans and have other obligations than just this subreddit, naturally. Hence this post; Maybe it's time to introduce a few more mods since the sub is growing and 3 moderators might not be enough, maybe add a local too, it's /r/Dubai after all, and can help translate arabic posts, culture questions and other miscommunications that can arise from them. 
   
I feel that at one point, word will be spread around and eventually have this sub blocked, or maybe reddit entirely, because this is directly related to Dubai, and not the more general /r/worldnews. I find lots of interesting info and discussions here on local news, offers, shops, advice, new places to try out and things to do in the weekend, also bringing people from different parts of the world together in one place, all which may somewhat be hard to find elsewhere, and I hate for this place to get blocked.

5% tax is nothing. 

I come from the UK originally. 

Whilst there, I was paying 20% vat on everything I purchased. You people in UAE don’t realise or appreciate how cheap everyday items and food are. Even with 5% tax, it’s still a heck of a lot cheaper here. Try buying fuel in the UK. At least a third of the price is fuel tax, then they put the 20% vat ON TOP of that!

Now to my salary. In the UK, the government were taking 40% of my salary as income tax. On top of that, they also took 12% national insurance which pays for the British army to invade countries I’ve never heard of and have no interest in. So for every 10 hours i worked, I only got paid for 5!!!

People here don’t seem to realise that living in the uae is not a right, it’s a privilege and paying 5% tax for that privilege is NOTHING in the grand scheme of things. 

Quit complaining, suck it up and be happy for the opportunity to live and work in a world class city like dubai rather than being stuck in some backwards subcontinent or third world dump.

In exchange for that I would get nearly free school all the way to a PhD, cheap healthcare (except eye and dental), some limited unemployment benefit and I'd be paying for a retirement system that will probably stop existing before I can benefit from it.

No more weird eyeing *(hey why you taking a shower/what the hell you doing)* or complaints to the staff *(once in Florida, I was at a restaurant when it was Dhuhr, I was wudhuing and were complaint against, even though I made no mess!)*. However always clean up after yourself if you're doing wudhu in a public restroom. We are blessed to have cleaning staff here everywhere that understands this and cleans after us.

4. Azaan: No more checking the Muslim Assistant 😉 or breaking the fast minutes earlier 😅 *(been there, done that)* You get to hear Adhaan in most of the public places and the Muadhins are quite melodious. 

4. Ramadan: it's everywhere 🎉 everyone respects and even non Muslims seem to accept and appreciate it. 

So enjoy my friends! You'll only be able to experience this kind of global environment with amazing tolerance only in Dubai ♥️


P.S. just some observations of a newbie in DXB over the first few days of Ramadan!

92,submission,8l8ouv,2018-05-22 13:28:25,"Dubai: Memories from when I submitted my resignation You shrug your shoulders.

You ask yourself the nagging, painful question: *""What else can I do?""*. You don't sleep the night before. *""It's not my country,""* you say. You go to the office. Avoid eye contact, slip a quick greeting to your workers to get it out of the way.

*""Years of my life, sweat and tears in this company, and it's come to this.""*

There's  nothing more degrading than the raw pursuit of money, you learn. You  walk downstairs to HR. There's a lock with a passcode on one of the  doors \- and no one knows why.

Perhaps it's to protect the department from a barrage of employees who feel they've been wronged.

**Walking on eggshells**

You timidly request a meeting with the HR clerk. There receptionist is rude and dismissive \-especially this time.*""Just wait for some time, ok,""* she says. The clerk is out \- it could be a lunch, coffee, cigarette or bathroom break, and she could be hours.

But  you're past the point of no return now. You take a seat and pretend to  read an old 2012 policy leaflet that's been sat on the table for who  knows how long.

You  hear the carpet rustle and a door swing open. The relentless buzz and  flicker of the fluorescent ceiling light whirrs on, penetrating sallow  faces that dare to look up and glance at the wall\-mounted\-clock.

The  clock, a cheap plastic job, had been a gift from the stationary supply  firm, back before the crash, when sales were brisk and companies  massaged themselves with the scented ooze of cash and pride, handily on  sale at all major places around the city.

**Stationary life**

The  boss of the particular stationary firm had long fled. Over the years,  his wealth had expanded with his waistline, while his marriage didn't  die \- it just made a costly relocation to a tiny island of bitterness in  an archipelago of indifference and bruised feelings.

The  trip there had been long and tedious, although luckily, both had a  business\-class seat on a prominent Gulf airline to soften the journey.  Before this trip that was their marriage even began, they had even been  picked up at the airport with a branded Volvo that looked a lot like a  hearse.

The last time his former employees tracked him down on Facebook \- *quite some time ago, in fact* \- they saw his paunch had shrank \- right in keeping with the humility of his home.

**Back to black**

So  the clerk has walked in. The mood stiffens and relaxes at the same  time. You half\-rise to your feet to meet the clerk, but they start  talking with another co\-worker.

A few weeks back I kicked off my blog and shared it with you guys here. I've seen a few people here who seemed interested in what I had to say. 

Two days ago I published a post which I felt was more relevant to r/dubai than my usual posts. I think I will be sharing the very relevant posts with you guys here going forward.

The post is about what I call the belonging complex with people who are born here or spending the majority of their lives here. I will only share parts of the post here that I feel comfortable sharing on Reddit. just doesn't feel right posting the specifics here for some reason. The other minor details (personal ones and personal stories) will only be on the blog I think

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For as long as I remember, I’ve had friends from different backgrounds. In fact, if we consider my closest friends, then most of them come from two completely different cultures themselves. However, we all grew up in the same city. We went to the same school and more often than not, the same university. We all grew up in a place where we are all expatriates and found ways to adapt to this diverse surrounding and somehow learned to love it.


LIFE AS AN ADULT

The shaping of a personality is kinda tough when the surrounding is that diverse. It creates a conflict in many people.  The majority of young adults that I have seen learn to develop a sense of belonging to a particular geographical location. Some develop the connection with the place they grew up in and others develop it with their home countries (sometimes without ever visiting those countries).

This is where the “belonging complex” comes in. I see many complaints about this torn mixed identity. They complain that they don’t know where they belong and where home actually is. Some even go into some sort of a crisis mode where the person loses purpose as they can’t seem to find themselves rooted anywhere that wants them or appreciates them. It’s honestly sad to see when it hits someone that hard.

 

PERSONAL VIEW

I personally have the same feeling. At my current stage in life, I don’t feel like I belong to any specific place or country. The only difference is that I LOVE THAT FEELING. What I found in this feeling is a sense of liberation and freedom. I know that I can pack my bags and move at any minute and start a life I can actually enjoy almost anywhere on earth (barring the political/visas issues). I find this feeling to be a blessing in today’s world not something to hate and whine about. It’s something to embrace and appreciate. To be completely honest, I never had the “belonging complex” or the need to feel a sense of belonging. However once I consciously adopted this view, things got even better in the way I lived my life. I generally felt happier knowing I was blessed enough to feel this… liberated?

 

2000 YEARS LATER

Home is where the heart is – Pliny the Elder

Around 2000 years ago a Greek philosopher named Pliny the Elder said: “Home is where the heart is”. 2000 years later, the saying is still quite well known. I have a slightly different approach to Pliny’s words. I kind of try to find a way to take home with me wherever I go. In a way, make wherever you go feel like home. It a small world and having one place constantly dragging you back to it will hold you back and won’t let you reach your potential. You can be reminiscent of the place you think you belong to, but you really don’t owe it much. If your personal development will thrive elsewhere, it’s time to make a move.

The corolla was pretty good but wasn't exactly fun to drive nor was it economic. It cost me 1750 a month to rent. 
I'm going to be living in Dubai for 2 more years so I need one that I can get at least 2 years of warranty on.

So please drop some suggestions. Going through dubizzle I found a few cars. 
Mazda 6, mazda 3, corolla, accord. Personally I've only ever driven a range rover and a fortuner back at home (Saudi Arabia), both of which were more fun to drive than the 150,000 kms+ corolla that I rent. 
What car would you recommend? 
Dealer vs individual? 
How do I get a car checked to make sure I'm not being ripped off? 
What all is covered by the warranty?
GCC spec only?

122,submission,9lt7ht,2018-10-06 08:18:10,"Noon.com: Too Big, Will Fail I was looking for reviews about Noon.com and found this article: [Too Big, Will Fail](https://medium.com/@bader/noon-com-too-big-will-fail-d9b7efa179ae)

This article is not intended to hurt the trademark of Noon or its shareholders. I do this review to let others avoid the mistakes and make eCommerce much better even without a one billion dollar in funds.

Summary:
Noon.com is an eCommerce website tries to compete with Amazon and its company Souq, and other eCommerce platforms in GCC and MENA. Noon has 1$ billion in funding, but the start of the company was complicated and delayed the launching date.

When they announce it to the public, they hired many people and spent money but they could not start at exact time which gave me an indicator that they can not start because they thought it is big and hard to manage. You can not compete with Amazon within months. During the preparation to open the platform, they joined the bidding over Souq, but it was a smart decision to sell Souq to Amazon just to create a new monster for Noon. They (As Emaar) acquired JadoPado, and 51% of Namshi which is a mistake that no eCommerce company would do it. I think those decisions led the management to make many mistakes and failures, and leave Noon after a short period of time. (JadoPado Founder Resignation)

Weakness:
Noon is not weak right now, they have the power of money which can make everything easy. It will not last forever because the main competitor can hold his breath more than you. The most important thing now is to merge all eCommerce businesses in one platform or focus on one only.

Marketing. Same old ways of marketing which I believe will not add any value to any business nowadays. Do you think targeting influencers’ audience will create more revenue to you? What if the audience tried something before from this influencer and did not like it, do you think they will like his/her next offer from Noon? How to reach more people? Think again. It is easy, it is not only affiliation system and discount codes.

There is a problem with reaching the customers. The way how it is presented to the public was wrong, and they can fix it now, but they must change the look and make it more attractive to customers and investors. Focus on the price.

Reach more customers by providing something good, even if you do not have everything. The biggest mistake was to serve many countries at the same time without having the resources. They should start from Saudi Arabia first, then expand to UAE which I think it is in process now.

How to Survive?
The main reason of this article or review because of an interview with Mr. Mohammad AlAbbar with AlKhaleej newspaper that GCC governments should stand against big companies like Amazon. This is wrong to prevent big companies to be in the GCC, because it will lead for monopoly and limited players in the market to control the price as much as they want which already exist in other industries and sectors. To survive and kill the new big monster is to change the business model a little bit. An agreement with eBay will not help Noon to survive in this market.

After a research I found that Noon is buying its own inventory and resell it to customers. If you can not produce, then do not buy it. I think they should not products and be responsible for delivery and shipping at the same time. We know that you have money, but they must let other companies make some profit in this market. They sell it at discount for Noon, but not that discount to let them cover the cost of handling, shipping, and delivery. Buying X Product, for Y% Discount, which is usually between 30% to 40% will not cover your cost from handling, shipping, and delivery. Select one need, and make profit from it. If you want to keep the same model of buying products and resell it, then you must create a new company for fulfillment, local delivery, and international shipping, but they decide to do it under Noon Umbrella. Create do not acquire. They labelled their company as a big company, create small companies instead of making it as department in your company.

Second, If they want to be a middle man and be responsible about fulfillment which gives them a great margin, then make agreements with companies to register and use the platform instead of competing with those companies except if you want to buy them all. In addition, focus on Small businesses which are the main players in eCommerce, and they can add a value to Noon more than big companies. There are 20,000 small business registered in as an online eCommerce in Saudi Arabia alone. This mean they can add more than 500,000 product to your platform. Allow them to use Noon’s facilities as storage for small business and implement new Fulfillment Model for them. You will create a new monster from small companies to compete with the big monster.

Third, Noon must take the advantage of online payments and create its own payment platform. Again Create, do not acquire. Make it public and let other people use it. When Amazon acquired Souq, they acquired a payment solution called PAYFORT. Noon must create a payment solutions platform that can help in transferring a region that uses cash more than online payments, which PayPal can not understand yet and led them to focus on other markets.

Last thing, the user experience and User Interface have many mistakes. You are selling a product, and I do not need to see something about Pros and Cons, make your own review system, no need to bring reviews from other websites. I am coming to Noon to make a purchase, and leave the Pros and Cons to customer. It is like going to Toyota and the sales guys telling you Nissan is better in interior.

Final words, I love Noon and its Founder, they have a vision to change, but I think they must do some changes a little bit.

\- with all the job insecurity, continue living with families in expensive places when you have cheaper rent options

\- buy an expensive car on loan.

\- putting children in expensive schools when you have other options. (i mean the board issues the final certificate and that is what matters in the end, not the school)

\- so much credit card and debt already

\- admitting their job will be over anytime soon and yet not sending families back and still in their comfort zone. Thinking when the bad times will come they say, ""we shall see""

\- no plan B/exit strategy in place. ""This is my home, i will stay here no matter what"". yes, tell me that when you are in need of a visa mate.

The worse thing is, they start blaming things and say ""we don't have PR. things is overpriced etc"". seriously man. I noticed the biggest person the person should blame for the failures is none but him/herself.

Another bugger is the guy who drives 140 , slows down in front of camera to a 100 and picks up to 140 again after the camera passes.

Either be the royal arsehole and don't break at all to prove you're loaded or stop playing for the galleries because I know you can drive fast. 

Add the bugger who speeds up when you flash him, because somehow it hurts his ego that a driver can go faster than him, and you have the complete package of Dubai drivers who are stupid, arrogant and have no clue.

UAE is the most expat friendly country I've ever come across. But now as I learn an European language having left the UAE, I am trying to figure out what went wrong. Two decades in UAE and barely any language fluency for me.

People say the arabic education system for expats suck but I've seen first hand how it's the society which treats it as a burden. They treat it as if it cannot go together with their STEM subjects (especially Indians due to horrid rote system).

Arabic is first to be neglected. My school teachers would actually bargain with my Arabic teacher for extra slots. The kids wouldn't listen to the teacher. The teacher I had was amazing but not only deprived of any ability to properly teach but severely undercut, you see the example I provided above.

This is never the case with other countries. I see plenty of same kind of people go to Germany after studying German for 1 year. I am more or less in the same category. 

Ofcourse, Will Power is #1 and I have failed when it comes to Arabic. However, there needs to be something done more. English alternatives are overwhelming.

It is extremely hard to get by in many European countries as a resident without knowing the language. 

I really loved the move in Dubai where some English Translations were replaced by Transliterations on road signs not so long ago. This was crazy enough for Jumeirah Janes to start going crazy on social media. 

This motivates people to learn. In Europe, They offer long term residencies which is a big motivator for the people.

In the GCC, People don't get that long term incentive oe anything else. I've seen hundreds of people tell me they are gonna leave UAE in 2 years. 20...30 years later, they are still here. Other's who planned to live long, ended up losing jobs and packing up in 5.

Amidst all this, I will always have a deep regret for missing out on Arabic. I hope I can learn it. Infact I think I know less Arabic now than I used to know as a kid when hanging out with arab kids, fighting with them and playing football in the streets 😂


Ironically, I have been using more Arabic in Europe than UAE when I talk in broken Arabic to a Syrian kid (refugee) who doesn't speak English.

*TL: DR* Expats live for decades here, don't know arabic. This is a multi faceted complex problem which must be tackled. 
I believe every language is special. There is never a disadvantage when you learn a language. Arabic is too neglected for expats. Needs reform and incentives.",1,"['dubai', 'uae', 'arabic', 'people', 'sharjah', 'country', 'abu', 'dhabi', 'emirates', 'like']",uae_cities_region,0.53,1,20,2019

Compared to other locations such as phuket ,the hotels here are not fooling with the custumers.
i booked with adagio al barsha cause i really like theirs 2 bedrooms but so disappointed that the chinese have taken over all the hotel,and instead they upgraded me to suite 3 bedrooms at Novotel, 39th floors, 220 m2.
Went to some restaurants with zomato hold, and for now the waiters were nice.
I always tip, 5-10 dhs even the taxi,delivery guys.The indian ,philipino people are so nice, friendly, always smiling , most because of my gorgeous baby daughter.
The only people with attitude were french at kite beach, like speaking out loud that they have a large villa, a large garden.so low and funny.
So now after thinking if we would settle here and leave zurich, yeah in a heartbeat.my wife has appointments with others company this week through a talent hunter.
Just to say to those living here  modestly that if i didn t have children i would gladly be the next one even for a few years.

280,submission,e5fo6o,2019-12-03 15:13:22,"Dubai Stank - a PSA So, as you may have noticed, people in Dubai tend to smell worse than people in a lot of other places.  Some friends and I were discussing this, and I thought I’d share our collective knowledge, for any newbies.

Why do the laborers smell bad?

Social and economic reasons.

Social.  Sometimes they come from cultures that don’t use deodorant and are more used to B.O.  Also, they often come from cultures where women do all the laundry, but they’re here without their wives and moms to wash their clothes for them – so they just wear the same dirty clothes again.

Economic.  Deodorant costs money.  Washing clothes costs money.  Even if they’re in a labor camp that provides washing machines and free laundry soap, having enough clothes to wear a clean set every day until laundry day?  That costs money.  Having the space to hang out your wet clothes out to dry costs money.  Also, washing clothes takes up precious free time and energy you don’t have because you’re always working (for more money).

What can you do about it?

Nothing much.  Well, if you’re a woman you can use the ladies-only metro car, but other than that, just remember that their lives sorta suck, and be tolerant.  Fortunately, Dubai Taxi put in a policy requiring hygiene standards for their taxi drivers, so it’s not as bad as it was a few years ago.

Why do the rest of us smell bad?

If you’ve noticed that you need more deodorant than you used to, you’re not alone.  Pretty much everyone here agrees that they smell worse here than they used to.  Yes, even in winter.  Why?  No one knows.  Some people say stress makes sweat smell different and we’re all stressed.  Some people say it’s something in the water we wash in.  But really, no one knows.  

What can you do about it?

Well, since we don’t know what causes it?  Not too much other than more soap, deodorant, and frequent clothes-changes.  
But there are some things.

Baking soda.  Sprinkle it in your shoes and in the laundry hamper you keep your smelly gym clothes in.  When your shirts start to stink even after a wash, make a paste of baking soda and water and cover the armpits of the shirt with it.  Let it sit a few hours before you wash them.

Vodka.  For your dry-clean only outfits that you wear more than once between cleaning, (suit jackets, etc.) take a spray bottle and fill it 50-50 with vodka and water (use filtered water in case it really *is* the water that is making everything stinky).  When you take off the outfit at the end of the day, put the spray bottle on “mist” and spray the diluted vodka on the armpit area.  The chemicals in the vodka eat up the bacteria that causes B.O.

Salicylic acid.  This stuff is used to combat acne.  However, it turns out that the oil and bacteria that causes pimples is similar to the oil and bacteria that causes B.O.  So, if you can get your hands on say, some Stridex Maximum Pads, you can use them to wipe down your underarms after washing, and that’ll do a lot to keep the B.O. down.

Body hair removal.  Body hair holds on to both body oils and the bacteria that creates B.O.  Trimming this down a lot (if you’re not into shaving certain parts) will help keep the B.O. down.

Good luck, and stay fresh.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.56,4,17,2019

We set up our shop and so far it’s been going really good. We rented out an apartment in JLT and it’s a delight seeing such amazing views and infrastructure. The people we’ve met so far have been really nice and helpful too. I’ll be starting my uni soon here too and can’t be any more excited!


Like any newcomer here one would stalk the hell out of this place online because of curiosity about this desert wonder. I watched videos about great places to visit here, upcoming stuff that’s architecturally mind blowing...I mean even drinking Starbucks and tim hortons was an experience for me as living in a small town in India I didn’t have the chance to do that. We are excited for the lifestyle that we’ll have here. 


We planned to come here for good. Even if we do leave back it won’t be sooner than 2030 as it’s a new business and we are loving it here (as of now).


But the thing that has been irking me is whenever I search Dubai on google or YouTube I’m instantly bombarded with negative stuff like Dubai economy meltdown, recession due, worst place to live etc. I even saw a comment where a guy who had a dilemma like me asked that he set up a new business in Dubai and now seeing all the negative videos he is scared what to do and people literally replied to sell and move somewhere else before it’s too late!!

i've commented in the past about the flaws of the justice system in Dubai, so i was surprised a little to read this. 

Its encouraging to see the law being applied here. whether or not an expat would get the same punishment is another matter, but i think this is progress. 

Assuming the Appeal isnt immediately successful, and the prison isnt a cushty hotel somewhere, i may well be in danger of having misjudged the Emiratis justice system. I await the results with bated breath.

Al Ain water still has good quality bottles, they are much more solid/sturdy compared to the paper-like plastic of Masafi or Nestle Water.

372,submission,fkgj30,2020-03-18 04:40:43,"I think I may had the best shawarma in Dubai. I have to get fresh for work in the morning, but I cannot wait to get this story out of my system. I've been tossing in my bed, thinking about the most amazing shawarma I had last night.

I had the honour of eating the best shawarma in Dubai last night. I was starving, because I hadn't eaten any substantial amount of food for nearly 3 days. I found this nice little shawarma joint, in a very neat and quiet corner in Karama.

As soon as I ordered for a shawarma, the Indian shawarma cook brandished his steel stick and meat sword, rubbing one against the other, sharpening the edge. It was surreal, watching and hearing someone else expertly wield and smash cutlery, almost giving it an ASMR feel. Hunger can be quite trippy, I guess. Anyways, this man ran up to me, while I was making a few custom adjustments to my shawarma, and tried to sell me some cheap ballpoint pens, but I told him no, I don't need a pen. I have plenty of pens lying on my desk at work. Does this man not understand basic supply and demand economics?

So, I told the cook to put in extra mayonnaise, tahina and a little more chicken. He didn't look too pleased, but he did pop more of the stuff in, reluctantly. I told him to remove the tomatoes earlier, because I hate vegetables in general. Also, told him to our some of that spicy chilly sauce. Mhmm!

Anyways, the street pen vendor is still around, and asks me to give him some money, if I didn't want to buy the pens, because he said he hadn't eaten in a week, and needed money to buy some food.

As soon as cook hand delivered me some of the juiciest pieces of chicken in town, coated in spicy sauce, tahina and mayo (no veggies) wrapped in warmed Arabic bread, I rip the paper wrapper up, and engulf the top part of the shawarma with my salivating mouth. I proceed to utterly decimate the shawarma, while little scraps of chicken, sauce, spit and stuff flying out of my ravenous mouth hole. 

Time slowed down around me, as I look deep into the pen vendors eyes, claiming the shawarma to myself, establishing myself way up in the hierarchy to which all men are subject, poor or rich. He looked at me with a sense of a disappointment (and maybe a genuine concern for my wellbeing?), because in that moment, I was the lion who chased down, and mauled and killed a zebra on the Serengiti plains, whereas he was a mere hyena who could only cower and watch me chomp down on my kill, with its gnashing jaws working overtime.

After downing the shawarma, and chasing it down with a can of Mountain Dew, and letting out a long, thunderous and satisfying burp, I paid the bill, and walked home, and collapsed on my bed, still reeling from the most shawargasmic experience of my life.

Fellas, I think we all have to be grateful for all the blessings in our life, and never take anything for granted. I hope my experience reminds you to take what's yours, and win every day ever.

We are trying to raise awareness about the fees our two telecoms are charging. Honestly, according to world [stats](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_price_rankings?itemId=33) uae ranks number 1 in being the most expensive in telecom fees.

Look - it's a tough period for all of us right now - especially our businesses. We need a break from these costs. They can afford a 20% drop in their fees. They received a huge discount from Dewa and Adwea, they got rental holidays from all the malls - nothing is passed on to customers!.

People looking for jobs - are getting bills of 500 to 700 dhs for mobiles per month. 

One thing I know for sure is that we love this country and its people are generous. I am a strong believer that if we stand together - these companies will listen.

That equals to about 79,875 tests per million people.

Putting that into perspective, the US has a total of 849,092 cases. However, they have only done 13,071 tests per million people. If their testing was brought to the scale being done here, they’d potentially have A LOT more cases.

The large number of tests being done everyday are bound to identify a few positive cases. We should all, instead of worrying, look to support anyone who is in a difficult situation and help each other get through this together. 

As a country, UAE has had one of the best responses to the whole situation, and I’m sure many will agree with me on that.

Edit: to be clear, I meant that a lot of people I know are responding really well to the precautions being taken. However, they’re overreacting when speaking about how cases are growing uncontrollably and that it’s really unsafe. If anything, I feel the precautions being taken here have made it one of the more safer countries to be in

Edit 2: Reading the comments, I do understand your points! I just wrote this based on what I’ve experienced with people I know. Glad to hear everyone’s insights as well. I’m in no way saying that we should ease up.

Efforts by Rta and the police to help finding this taxi driver has been futile. He didn’t put on the meter even though I told him I didn’t have cash but card. So I had to borrow from a colleague to give him. The hustle of getting the cash made me forget my scooter😢😢.

How the hiring system works in Dubai? 

Does under the table system works over here? I've heard stories though.

Is the HR culture is different over here compared to other countries?

Even though we have amazing platform like LinkedIn to organize this vast area of hiring and getting employed. But it seems like someone needs to take time to educate these old and grumpy HRs to educate about how Linkedin works.

They need to use this beautiful platform that people have created and utilize it to the fullest. I work with one of the biggest family group and I can say that our HR is still used to the old naukrigulf. Now, I'm not saying its bad, it just that there are other platforms available which are better comparatively. I mean I have applied to hundreds of jobs over the LinkedIn over the period and no single response.

Something is wrong somewhere. I have been approached with recruiters directly as well expressing their interest in my profile. But it seems people have taken Linkedin as modified facebook and just concerned about the no. of connections one has.

Can someone their positive experience of being on Linkedin or the good of HR side in UAE? Because I think no-one can deal with more negativity now. 

P.S. I like to believe in people. They can be changed with little perspective and guidance. But it has to come from the management and not some lower level employee.",1,"['dubai', 'uae', 'arabic', 'people', 'sharjah', 'country', 'abu', 'dhabi', 'emirates', 'like']",uae_cities_region,0.46,0,11,2020

**Disclaimer: below is my personal opinion, it is not meant to offend anyone.**

**Aditional disclaimer (re-post edition): Beauty of the Internet is that we can be more honest with each other. Additionally besides the negative I have seen a lot of positives that we all share and make us human, but they are too many to name. Also I had a blast meeting you all.**

**Me and Dubai:**

Closest approximation would be I felt like MR. Worf on the Enterprise (Star Trek ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ). I am 1.83 cm tall and weigh 100Kg with a strong build and I'm completely average in the Balkans. But in Dubai I felt tall, it was great. But it was not only my build, it was also cultural. We communicate directly and are rather aggressive and confrontational. Often I was the only one arguing with my boss in the meetings. Same boss would constantly misunderstand my bantering with the colleagues and I would have to explain that I am not insulting them, but joking. I hated being called sir all the time. Where I live people would laugh at you if you were called or calling someone sir. I rarely met someone from my country and felt isolated and out of place most of the time. Initial infatuation with Dubai passed quickly, heat, sand and the concrete did their job.

**What I liked:**

Whole world is there, I mean the people. I really enjoyed mingling with other nationalities. Money, I got 20000 AED pay, which is around 6 times I would get at home. Transportation infrastructure, roads are awesome and I can still hear the metro train whistling. I always wanted to live in a metropolis. Not anymore.

**What I disliked:**

Heat, oh god the heat! Food! I never liked the commercial one (but I love a good Mandi), so I had to cook for myself. Choice of red meat was sub par but the fish was awesome. Rules, rules, rules can't do this can't do that. Coming from part of the world where there is much more personal freedom, I never was at ease at speaking my mind or doing the things I do. Out of spite I never got the alcohol licence :D. Rampant capitalism is the other, sometimes felt like I was in a amusement park.

**Observations of Nationalities:**

**Indians:**

Working in IT i met a lot. They can be noisy at times and they don't seem to posses a sense of personal space, but they are hardworking, intelligent and genuinely good people. They do seem to avoid confrontation and are conformists. They let themselves be exploited because of this.

**Pakistanis:**

Similar to Indians but slightly more aggressive.

**Arabs:**

The ones I met were often closed minded and hypocritical (excluding Arabs of the Levant, they are cool). Ones in position often treated those below harshly. But I did also meet a bunch of progressive ones who were cool. There seems to be a strife between the two groups. I sincerely hope the later ones will prevail.

**Filipinos:**

Very cheerful and energetic. Soft spoken.

**Brits:**

I have to say that my people historically have a dislike for them. That only deepened in Dubai. I found them arrogant and full of air. Individual exceptions exist.

**Africans:**

Wild as expected :D. I liked them.

**Australians/New Zealand:**

Cool people, positive mindset, hardworking. Always joking around.


**Girls:**

Oh god girls, how I miss the girls! It's not a place to marry, but the variety makes a mans head spin. Indian girls are surprisingly cute, Filipinas are 90% chubby teddy bears but the 10% are a fine as hell and I can still see the curves of the African goddesses.

**Why I left:**

I was homesick and overworked I also yearned to start my own business back at home.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.91,9,68,2020

I'm thinking about to quit jobs here and move to another country the reason is I'm boring about living here (don't get me wrong Dubai is great but it just not my type) I'm living here almost 2 years now and I got quite high salary but I'm not happy (company culture, politic, etc.) the only problem is I'm not sure should I move to another country which got much lower income (about half of my current income) but I'm happier  (The country that I has experience living/working there before) or still working here but got frequent travel instead (of course it will use a lot of money but it only happen after COVID-19 situation get better).

I'm a student studying abroad in the US. I  have a resident visa and am (hopefully) planning to return back home after college ends. I have been on hormone replacement therapy for a bit now, and was wondering if I can carry those medications back with me. I look and present as my birth gender so I shouldn't have a problem passing through myself. I do not know if those medications are completely banned or simply controlled and there's conflicting information everywhere I look. Would I be able to carry them with a doctor's letter?

I'm not sure they even go through the medications as other medications I've carried before seemed completely untouched. I have to be in Dubai throughout summer till colleges reopen and cannot stop taking my medications for so long. Would it be incredibly risky to get them with me or should I be mostly fine? Any help would be greatly appreciated!!

Edit: I've also previously carried antidepressants (both with and without a letter) without any issues.

""We have noticed reckless behaviour from certain individuals, violating instructions,"" he says. ""This has big reprecussions.

""It appears that some people in society are being irresponsible and the insistence of some on not respecting what is requested, thus the public prosecutor has amended the list of fines and penalties.""

Some of the new fines include:

Dh50,000 fine for whoever doesn't do home quarantine and doesn't repeat tests as requested 

Dh50,000 fine for anyone who doesn't adhere to quarantine 

Dh10,000 fine for damaging/lost smart devices

533,submission,gmd7t8,2020-05-19 03:46:11,"Dear Reddit, A Cry for help. I can't believe it has come down to this....

About 8 months ago my dad had been made redundant from his workplace. And we had decided to stay back here as I was in my final year of High School and be done with exams and go back to India, but with the pandemic situation, all the flights and the construction had been halted, which wasn't favorable for my dad to be able to get another job nor for us to go back. All 4 of us are on a visit visa which is valid until the end of this year and our home contract is about to come to an end in a few days.

As we are in the midst of a very critical financial situation right now, we are trying to find a place to stay until we are called by the Embassy for a flight back. My parents have tried all that they could and Wasl Properties, they aren't giving us any exemptions and want us to vacate and as the school fees weren't paid younger brother was not able to attend online classes as well. 

Seems like everything is crashing down right in front of us and we are not able to do a thing. If anyone here could be of **any help at all**, we can't rent another apartment with a contract as we do not have a resident visa and cannot afford to stay at hotels or vacation homes. If someone here can help us or knows someone, please, please let me know.

We are truly hanging by the thread and hope for good to come our way this holy month. For anyone else out there facing hard situations, Just have a little faith, my friend.

P.S   If someone here is renting out apartments or has an Airbnb or knows someone, please reach out to me and do us a favor.     I couldn't think of anything else rather than to ask help on Reddit, Hope everything goes well.

A staggering 70% of businesses in Dubai expect to close their doors within the next six months as the coronavirus pandemic and global lockdowns ravage demand, a survey by the Dubai Chamber of Commerce revealed Thursday.

The Chamber surveyed 1,228 CEOs across a range of sectors between April 16 and April 22, during the emirate’s strictest lockdown period. Nearly three-quarters of those surveyed were small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. Of the respondents, more than two-thirds saw a moderate-to-high risk of going out of business in the coming six months: 27% said they expected to lose their businesses within the next month, and 43% expect to go out of business within six.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.64,4,9,2020

I'm an owner of an SME here in dubai that I became part of a few years ago. Fell inlove with the place.. did my absolute best and got it on it's feet, better than it's been in YEARS. Actually profitable, too! but.. there goes my social life. Slowly, during the 3 years of working on this project, 80% of the people I knew were now replaced with business acquaintances. But hey, I knew what I was getting myself into and it was a dream job, to say the least. So, happy as hell! but also.. ya'know? still got the core group I'm lucky to have of course. And even during Corona, I'm working 8x harder to sustain somewhat good numbers... until I met her. Her name is J, she's one of the most beautiful, enchanting and gorgeous girls I've ever laid my eyes on, she, almost immediately, became a center of attention in my life. Fast forward 4 failed ''relationships'' in a single year, I realized I shouldn't jump from 1 girl to another and decided to stop completely and focus on business. Then J came along. She's a G as much as she's a J, a true, passionate and intelligent human being. My god she's amazing, her taste for life is pure thirst and has the cutest attributions a beautiful soul can ever have. Things were off to a great start.. I knew it was real, so I tend to be intense. I'm a musician by trade and profession, what did you expect? I function on passion and creativity. Eventually, though, her workload got the best of her and downwards went the conversation... And now, I find myself far from J, and far from me. Corona's got locked up, my company will survive, but my mentality might change, forever. And I don't know what to do about it. I just want J, to be honest. But she doesn't really want me, I think.

589,submission,gqtoew,2020-05-26 13:15:19,"Virus Relief Comparisons (Singapore <> Dubai) You know, in Dubai/UAE sometimes we pride ourselves as being the ""Singapore of the Middle East"". So I was reading [Singapore's fourth stimulus](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-26/singapore-boosts-virus-relief-by-s-33-billion-with-focus-on-jobs?srnd=premium-middle-east&sref=9Wxj4kTx) package that they have just released, and it made me start to think - which measures do you guys think would be most appropriate in adopting (from all of them), given UAE's demographic classification?

I understand a lot of the below can't be applied as UAE's population is mostly expats - but in my opinion some measures would really workout well to prop up the economy.

For example, t**he cash grants to SMEs to offset rental costs** can definitely assist in reducing cost and at least retaining staff in the short-term. What do you guys think?  
I've pasted here the main excerpt regarding the stimulus package:

Hey guys,  
My UAE driver's license got expired about a month ago, and I haven't renewed it. I have a few questions about the same:  
1) Of course I will be allowed to renew it later, with some fine for late renewal. But as I am not driving right now and there is no need as WFH, for how long or how many months am I allowed to not renew?  
2) Does anyone have any idea when RTA Smart Kiosk will start operating again? And will they be issuing a 5 year license on renewal?  


I realize that there is an option for online renewal, but that is only for a year, and after a year during the next renewal I will be needing an eye test as well. Or hopefully, I will be able to get my 5 year license renewal done, as new eye test are quite expensive, and right now (although it being a very small amount) I don't wish to waste it. I would rather wait a month or two more, pay 30 DHS as late renewal fee rather than pay 200 DHS for eye test plus renewal. In case you wish to PM me, great.

616,submission,gst2u3,2020-05-29 17:32:26,"The grass is always greener in Canada from Dubai. Living in UAE, I always hear people speculate how easy and simple Canada is, I got tired of explaining how life in Canada to each one individually and thought of sharing this here for every to have an idea what to expect, especially after many of my friends immigrating to Canada and had a scoop of mixed expectations.

The topic of migrating to Canada is being discussed regularly on this sub, I hope below helps.

Before I start, let me state as a Canadian, I personally welcome everyone to my beautiful country. I hope your move is a permanent and you become part of Canada working economic engine, to contribute and receive the plenty of offering Canada has.

Before counter-argument how, as a Canadian, I left Canada for UAE and welcome immigrants to Canada. I moved to UAE initially for my wife, her family was based here (not anymore) and she got a well-paying job at the time to excel her career.

I will list below the main challenges you might receive after the Canadian invitation. I personally hate it when someone complains about Canada, especially when they were not prepared for it.

**Canadian Credit Score** is key for every decision and purchases you have in Canada. Most if not all of my friends who migrated to Canada experienced difficulty finding a suitable place. This is because landlords would ask you to provide your credit score (which at the time would be low) and will find extreme hesitance to rent out your unit.

The argument for the landlord sake is that it is extremely difficult to evict a nonpaying tenant and the credit score will identify how good you are with payments. Landlords might ask you to pay between 9 months and a year upfront (this is illegal, and they won't do it in writing, just verbally or imply it)

**Edit*-Location** – unlike UAE, not everywhere in Canada is safe and advisable to live in. Gun shooting happens, you need to research extensively about the location before you move.

**Winter** Our winter is harsh, and you will not be able to comprehend it if you come from warm regions. Our summer on the other hand is beautiful, spring and autumn are heavenly. Expect to invest heavily in a proper jacket, long johns and boots.

**Public Transport** Similar to UAE most of the population in Canada relies on private cars to move around. Unless you find a place in the city centre, like Toronto, Calgary, you will expect extreme difficulties to move around. ESPECIALLY IN WINTER

**Service Industry** It is funny to mention this, but most of the people who moved there hated how difficult life in Canada is. There is no cheap labour in Canada. Thumb rule, if you can do it yourself, then finding someone else to do it will be VERY expensive. You will clean your own car, cook your own food, move your own furniture, fill your own gas, mown your own garden, shovel snow etc.

**Employment** finding employment is actually not that easy in Canada, you need Canadian experience, and you can’t get the experience without working first (go figure). You will need to connect with every possible contact and accept a demotion to enter your field. No one really cares about your experience in UAE or Dubai. Companies are very hesitant to hire none Canadian experienced candidate, they might hire you are as a Contractor rather than Fulltime (research this).

**Salaries** this is short and simple. Salaries in Canada as much, much lower than UAE and you are taxed on it aswel. You can know the expected role salary via a simple online search such as Indeed and Glassdoor. However there is no gap in payment, each job has a salary bracket. You are paid on what you bring to the table, rather than how you look behind the table. I actually advise you to take working environment seminars or courses, plenty of usual chitchats that happens in UAE offices would be used as a firable offence in Canada.

**Savings** If you are not vigilant and track every spending in UAE then kiss your savings goodbye, and maybe even go in debt. Most of your income will go to overpriced housing and phone bills. People do not go out often and do it on a weekly basis here. Eating out is leisure, every dollar saved makes a big difference.

**Medical** Not everything is FREE in Canada. Each province is slightly different in regards to medical coverage. But in summary, everything that insurance companies in UAE cover, is not cover is covered in Canada, and things which are usually covered in UAE is not covered in Canada. The provincial and federal medical is for extreme and important issues. Things such as multivitamins and other technical non-essential is not free, that includes dental. Yes, there is medical insurances packages you can buy to cover that, which is similar to UAE.

**Insurance** Canadian Insurance is one of the most expensive in the world. Everything in Canada needs to be insured, especially that you are liable for anything and everything. Standard sedan insurance for newcomers could range between 300 and 600 dollars a month. If someone slips on your house sidewalk, they might sue you and the insurance would be necessary at that time. With each accident or claim, expect your insurance to rise even further in the next billing cycle.

**We are nice, that is our culture** Canadians are culturally nice and polite, that is our culture. A Canadian being nice does not mean they like you or gullible, and that does not reflect our basic intention towards you. Canadian overall are extremely passive. Canadian tend to hide their emotions via a smile. This tends to be an issue for people who come from places or cultures where being nice means they like you and being angry means they do not. But we are overly helpful.

**Find your community**. If you are an Arab, Christian, Jew, European, Asian or anything basically. Find your community, communities are extremely helpful and there to newcomers.

**You are Canadian from Day 1**. Canada is multicultural, regardless of how you look or what your name is, you are expected to be Canadian until you state otherwise. The only difference between a permanent resident and a citizen is voting rights.

**Taxes** taxes, taxes, taxes, taxes, and taxes. Everything is taxed in Canada, depending on the province off course the rate varies. VAT in Ontario is 13% for example, even used cars and registered sales are taxed.

**We are not USA** compare us to the United States and we will ask you to leave the table. We are better than USA. We have our cons, but we always pursuit to better ourselves. Joke aside, we are competing neighbours who joke about this, end of the day we are one. 

Living in Dubai is relatively simple, safe and provides more financial possibilities. I have enjoyed every moment in UAE (well most of them) and may give it more time before moving back. Sometimes I do feel people in UAE are overly spoiled...sometimes.

I hope the above helps current UAE residents in evaluating their options and make the best step forward in their own interest.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.97,511,202,2020

They once lived in the shadows of the United Arab Emirates. Today, emboldened by improved relations between Israel and their current home, the Jews of the UAE are openly praying for the welfare of the Emirati government and its armed forces.

A video clip on the “Official Twitter Account of the Jewish Community of the UAE” begins with a desert scene and the figure of a man clad in the traditional long white robe worn by Emiratis, holding a large UAE flag. It cuts to a room set up as a synagogue, with a man in a Jewish prayer shawl shot from behind.

“May He who gives salvation to kings and dominion to princes, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, who delivers his servant David from the evil sword, who makes a way in the sea and a path through the mighty waters, bless and protect, guard and help, exalt, magnify and uplift the President of the UAE His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan,” the Hebrew-language prayer begins, chanted in Middle Eastern cantillation.

The blessing goes on to include the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and “all the rulers of the other Emirates and their crown princes.”

The video, which shows images of Sheikh Khalifa and Sheikh Mohammed, as well as various UAE sites, has subtitles in both Arabic and English, and includes a prayer that the government “deal kindly with us, the House of Jacob, and all the people of this land.”

While it is customary for Jewish communities to pray for the welfare of the leaders of the government of the country in which they live, the Jewish community in the UAE had [until recent years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-05/as-the-arab-world-warms-to-israel-a-synagogue-grows-in-dubai) shunned publicity. Since its Twitter account was opened last month, it has tweeted several times, including a [video](https://twitter.com/JewishUae/status/1264644423671066626) coinciding with the Muslim holiday Eid al-Fitr announcing that kosher meat is now available in Dubai.

The UAE, like most Arab nations, doesn’t have diplomatic ties with Israel. Yet relations have warmed in recent years over a shared distrust of Iran, and in tandem, the Jewish community in the Emirates has taken a higher profile. The UAE, too, is being more open about the warming ties, and is building a synagogue in Abu Dhabi that is to be part of an interfaith complex including a mosque and a church. The Abrahamic Family House project is expected to be completed by 2022, according to a Gulf News report last year.

Last month, a rare flight from the UAE arrived in Israel carrying medical equipment to help Palestinians fight the coronavirus pandemic, though at the same time, the Gulf nation has hewed to longstanding Arab positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, tweeted this week that “continued Israeli talk of annexing Palestinain lands most stop” because such a move would “constitute a rejection of the international & Arab consensus towards stability & peace.”",1,"['dubai', 'uae', 'arabic', 'people', 'sharjah', 'country', 'abu', 'dhabi', 'emirates', 'like']",uae_cities_region,0.89,17,31,2020

We are Dubai-based and the client was in Abu Dhabi. The client is a hospital. We applied yesterday morning on the bug-ridden website and realize each permit is actually one-way only. We had to apply for an in and an out permit, which we did at the same time.  When the site finally accepted both submissions, the  IN permit approval came across in 8-10 minutes but the out was still saying 'submitted successfully, wait for SMS'. To meet the delivery deadline, the delivery driver and the assistants head out, deliver the goods to the hospital and drive back to Dubai but are stopped at the border checkpoint. They show the IN acceptance, and the OUT still under process (now 8 hours later) and the police say NO, you can't pass. So the truck proceeds to sit there on the side of the highway waiting and waiting. The police, after being shown the whole application, knowing its a system thing still refuses to let them go home. Then they tell the driver and crew if they are not off the road, they will be violating curfew to boot. We have applied, called, web live chat, no answer, no help anywhere so we have to book the team into a hotel for the night. This morning comes and we apply again for them to come home.... rejected! Still no answer on any help request.

so let me tell you my story, I started working in a company before 4 months, everything went good until the corona lock-down happened, my company kept working for like 10 days then fully closed.

before that they still haven't finished my residence papers, they did the contract thing and I signed it then they stopped processing anything and they kept stalling.

afterwards, 5 people and I received a termination letter but after a meeting they returned 2 and I was one of them but still, nothing processed. 

The main problem is that Dubai gradually opened after the lock-down eased but my employer until this moment is fully closed, and as of what I heard the owner is out abroad.

so, do I get to do anything? do I get any compensation if I am to stop working/cancel from their company?

Today, the mod team would like to address something we've been seeing becoming more and more prevalent on r/DubaiCentral and be open in our communication towards you, our community. 

Recently, we've been seeing a lot of anti r/Dubai sentiment on this subreddit, a smattering of posts that question the difference between our subreddit and r/Dubai and/or bash one or the other. 

Therefore, we'd like to answer this FAQ as clearly as we possibly can. r/DubaiCentral is an *alternative community* for Dubai residents, expats and locals. We have a different approach to moderation and we're aiming for a different *feel* for this community.

We do *not* condone attacks on r/Dubai or any members of their mod teams. We are better than that. 

Regardless of your opinion of r/Dubai, you are welcome to participate on this subreddit.

That said, we cannot leave this stream of pointless posts that only bash r/Dubai unchecked. ~~Therefore, we have decided that posts that only bash r/Dubai and do not contribute anything in terms of community will be *locked*, effective immediately.~~ 

#TL;DR - please stop bashing r/Dubai, we can do better than this. As for why this subreddit exists, we want to foster more of a community feel. It's a simple difference in approach to moderation, nothing more. As per community discussion, we have reached the conclusion to not lock posts that bash r/Dubai.

Recently I’ve been getting a lot of inquiries about immigration to Canada, Australia, US, UK, New Zealand, etc.

**Due to the amount of fraud and misinformation in the immigration sector**, I’ve typed up a public service announcement at the recommendation of the lovely u/Gummers, to help clarify a few points, and cover some topics of interest:

\- **How do I avoid fraud?**

**- Where can I go?**

\- **Do I qualify to immigrate?**

\- **How long does it take?**

\- **What’s the basic process?**

\- **Can I get a Work Permit? Do I need a work permit to Immigrate?**

\- **What is a PR? When do I get a PR? What is the route to a citizenship?**

\- **Do I need an immigration law firm / consultant?**

\----------

There are two types of immigration; “Professional Migration” and “Investor Migration”. For this guide, we will be covering the former - “Professional Migration”, also known as “Express Entry (Federal)” (Express Entry for Canada and Australia are quite similar)

It’s a bit of a long read, but all the information is important! So without further ado, I present to you:

**A Simple Guide to Immigration**

You are ready to immigrate. You want to find a better opportunity for yourself, your family, or your future in a foreign country. You have friends & family who are there right now, and they’re telling you it’s great. You’ve even bought the suitcases already. What next? For the purpose of this guide, I will be covering Canadian immigration, as mentioned before the processes are quite similar for Australia and NZ.

**How do I avoid fraud?**

This question is the reason for this post. **I can not stress enough, of how much fraud there is in the immigration industry**. It’s rampant. Unfortunately, immigration as seen as a quick money making scheme by many firms, and there is plenty of “bait” in the “market”. Unauthorized or illegitimate firms have no regulations placed on them, they are not indemnified, meaning clients are not insured against malpractice.

Many firms employ a practice of retaining clients they know will never pass the criteria, but still retain them. Consultancies hide information, demanding payment before any evaluation. They retain clients that would not be able to clear an IELTS exam, charge hidden fees or lock clients into a monthly pay program that they can’t get out of. Some firms play the legal loophole, where they retain clients with CRS scores so low that they will never get out of the pool, then charge money for yearly case “renewals”. Another legal loophole is a firm that takes your money, legitimately, applies your case ( knowing from experience you will be rejected ), and just hand you the rejection from the government. They can use scare tactics, sell you work permits, etc.

**In order to avoid fraud:**

The first thing you must do is ask for their **ICCRC License number**. This is a license that is recognized by the Canadian government, and will be on the ICCRC website with the name of the lawyer, the name of the firm and contact details. If a firm is employing overseas ICCRC’s, it doesn’t mean they are scammers but it’s always better to have one in-house. For Australia it is **MARA**, with and for the same reasons. You always have the right to reach out to the ICCRC or MARA lawyer in question. If they are risking their license by servicing third party firms, they would want to know if anything fishy is going on.

Ask for a free evaluation. It is your right as a client to receive an honest evaluation as this will be your indicator of wether or not your case will be successful.

Ask to see past ITA’s or COPR’s, as proof of successful cases. **There are firms out there retaining 250 cases a month with not more that 25 ITA’s all year.** This is a red flag.

**Ask to see copies of licenses and certificates**. A genuine firm would be proud to display them for the world to see.

Ask many questions, clarify everything before you sign anything. **A regulated firm will have a regulated retainer agreement**, for which you will get plenty of time to read and understand.

**Never pay government fees to the firm**. There are some fees that come up during the course of the case, that need to be paid by you directly to the government, not by the firm.

Ask about malpractice indemnity. Is the firm insured?

You are the client, your money is sure as hell hard earned. There are plenty of firms who will respect that!

**Where can I go?**

As a professional migration candidate, there are quite a number of places you can go. The most popular countries are Canada & Australia, Canada being the most popular. It’s a great country, takes care of its people, has a diverse and multicultural experience to offer, along with all four seasons.

Canada also welcomes the most migrants annually, at a general rate of 1% of its population every year, currently at around 380,000. Recently however, our handsome Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has indicated that he wants a million people in 2 years time, which does mean more people in a shorter time, but doesn’t address how that will happen. More on that in point 6.

**Do I qualify to immigrate?**

Canada ( as well as Australia, NZ ) wants the best of the best. Young minds, young families, educated and with work experience. There are millions of people trying to go there for various reasons, so the immigration authorities have to be able to segregate the candidates that would fit best. They use 2 sets of criteria:

a) Personal Qualifications

Age ( Under 36 is best, but possible up to 41 )

Education ( Bachelor’s Degree or Diploma minimum, from a recognized institution )

Work Experience ( minimum 1 year, 3-5 is best )

English Language Capability ( in the form of an IELTS exam, with a score of 7 band in general category, also known as CLB9 )

Adaptability ( spouse’s education & english, family in Canada, Canadian work experience, etc )

All these are calculated in the first round of scores, and you need to get at least a 67 points out of a possible 100. ( Australia’s scoring system is “same same but different” ) This later leads to a second round of scoring called CRS ( comprehensive Ranking System ). More on that in points 3 & 4.

b) Career Demand in Canada

So you’ve passed the first round of scores, you’ve crossed 67 points, and now you’re wondering “Are we there yet?”. Not quite! The second set of criteria is one of the most critical, and depends directly on your choice in career / job. Even though you may have passed the first round, Canada will only grant you immigration if you are in demand in Canada. This is taken from a document published every few years, called the NOC ( National Job Classification). It classifies categories of jobs, duties and responsibilities, and Canada decides which categories are currently in demand. As of now, it’s categories allowed are NOC Codes 0, A and B.

This is because even though you may be capable, there could be a situation where you may not be able to get a job in Canada if you are not in demand. This will inevitably lead to a failure in the process either by you leaving the country or falling onto the government’s welfare system. You would also be taking a spot away from someone Canada needs. So, they will also apply this criteria to your case, before allowing a file submission.

**How long does it take?**

This is where there is a lot of misinformation in the “market”. People often get confused by conflicting information due to firms that don’t really have to comply with the code of ethics of fair practice and information. **It takes a minimum of 8 - 12 months to have a successful application, after your file is submitted.** The documentation process and time varies from client to client, with some clients being able to submit the file within a month or two, to upto 6 - 8 months. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, Canada has announced that they will be taking another 4-6 months after ITA ( invitation to apply for permanent residency) to process the application. More on that in point 4.

Yes. Believe it or not, that’s a more realistic time frame for your application. Some cases take even longer, with candidates waiting in the pool for 2 years or more, but a majority of candidates clear it within that time. This is not a means to discourage you, rather it should light a fire under your rear ends to get moving and take the first step!

**What’s the basic process?**

If you’ve come this far, congratulations! You haven’t been discouraged by the time it takes, and you are determined to freeze in the Canadian winters. The actual workings of each case is too much detail to get into in this post, for the sake of simplicity, it will be a brief overview. After passing the initial scoring round and making sure that your professional life is in demand in Canada, you start collection of your documents. The usual suspects are of course:

Passport copies of all applicants

Birth certificates

Marriage certificates

Education Credential Assessment ( Important )

Work experience proofs

IELTS exam results ( Important )

All the forms

Bank statements ( no, you do not need millions, just a fixed amount based on how many applicants in the case)

File Evaluation Report ( not needed if applying by yourself )

Your CRS score calculation

I want to expand on a few of the above-mentioned requirements.

a. ECA

This is an evaluation of your education documents. It’s done using government approved assessment bodies that will contact your study institution themselves and request sealed copies of your degree/diploma, transcripts, mark-sheets, and how popular you were ( just kidding about that last part ). Under no circumstances should you ever, ever try to submit fraudulent documents. They will find out, and you will be blacklisted.

b. IELTS

This can be difficult for some candidates. It is absolutely crucial to get this, and once again you should never, ever try to submit fraudulent test results. You need to get CLB9, which means an 8 in listening, and a 7,7,7 in reading, writing and speaking. I always tell my clients that it is actually the only part of the case that is under their control. You can’t change your age, no matter how hard you try. The same goes for your work experience, your education, your spouse’s credentials, etc. The higher the score you achieve, the higher the first round of scoring, leading to a high CRS score. I suggest a client invest in IELTS training to make a good score possible.

c. CRS score

Now even though this can be estimated using various calculators, it only becomes clear after the ECA and IELTS are in hand.

The comprehensive ranking system, was created after 8 years of development. It is not a human review, in fact it is a software based on algorithms, which take into account many factors including the NOC, analysis of the National Job Bank, recent migrants, applicants in the “Pool”, unemployment rates in Canada, etc.

There are monthly draws that take place and a CRS score is announced, anyone with that score and above are “Invited to Apply” for PR. These scores are public, and currently stand around 472. In fact, if your CRS score is lower than the “draws” consistently, you may be waiting long. This is the most important part of the case, in another later post I will try to outline how to improve this score in case you are in a situation where your scores are low, and you’re stuck in the pool.

Everything outlined above belongs to the **Federal Express Entry Category**. Another very popular way of successful immigration is **PNP (Provincial Nominee Program)**. This will be outlined in another post, as it’s a more frequent way to immigrate but not very understood.

————

After applying for immigration with all the required documentation, you will receive a file number. This is your UCI ( Unique Client ID ) and is the way to check on your status. It’s important to check it periodically, and if the CRS draw scores match your own CRS score, you will receive the ITA! What next?

You will then be asked for some other information. A medical test report, from authorized practitioners proving that you have a clean bill of health, in terms of having no communicable diseases. You may also be asked to submit proof of financial capability, depending on how many members of your family applying in the case, starting at around $13,000 CAD for the main applicant, plus another $4000 CAD per family member. Once these and a few other documents are submitted, you wait for the passport submission, and your immigrant visa (IMM01) !

**Can I get a Work Permit? Do I need a work permit to Immigrate?**

Here we go, welcome to the **biggest method of immigration fraud in the world**. Let me start by saying you do not need a work permit to immigrate. Immigration programs are citizenship programs, they have no ties to a work permit. However, hundreds of consultancy firms are out there selling work permits for thousands of dollars, and work through loopholes where they are safe and no legal action can be taken against them easily.

What is a work permit? The correct term here is LMIA ( Labour Market Impact Assessment ). When a Canadian (or Australian, NZ) employer has to hire someone from a foreign country, there’s a process. They have to publish in local and sometimes national newspapers that there is a job available, for 6 weeks or more. They have to work with the national job bank and database to find candidates. They have to prove to the government that there is no available citizen with the skills or even a citizen that can be trained for the job. They also have to spend upwards of $2500, sometimes more. The process can take over 6 months, and is difficult for the employers. LMIA’s are only available only for few select and specialized jobs.

Shady firms can make you believe thousands of work permits are available. This is a blatant lie. I do know of people who have got work permits, but they are very few in number, and unfortunately “sold” by the people who make it happen for upwards of $10,000. For the basis of immigration, it’s always best to consider that there are no work permits freely available for you, and it’s best to either qualify through the system or not apply at all if you don’t.

**What is a PR? When do I get a PR? What is the route to a citizenship?**

PR is permanent residency. When you do the first landing to Canada / Australia/ NZ, on your immigrant visa, you have to fill a couple of forms, and you are a PR. You receive your PR card, nice and shiny, and that becomes your identity until your citizenship. As a PR, you have all the rights as a citizen except for the right to get involved in Canadian ( Australian/NZ ) politics. The PR allows you freedom to live and work anywhere in Canada, access to social security and healthcare, subsidized university and college fees, free education for children in the school system, etc. You get it all!

The Canadian citizenship comes after you live in Canada for 1095 days ( 3 years ) after landing. This does not have to be consecutive, it is cumulative. You are granted a period of 1825 days ( 5 years ) in which you must complete 1095 days. You can travel freely, you can take long breaks, you can do whatever you like as long as you spend those 1095 days in Canada. After that time is up, you can apply for a citizenship. Some of my clients prefer not to take the citizenship for various reasons, in that case you only have to complete 730 days ( 2 years ) every 5 years to keep your PR indefinitely, while still enjoying all the benefits of a Canadian citizen. The stay requirement exists for all countries.

This is important: You can not renew or recover an expired PR, no matter how much money you spend hiring expensive lawyers. You will have to start all over again, and risk facing changes in immigration law. Once you have your PR confirmed for the next cycle ( 730 days / 2 years ), it’s best to complete the final year and apply citizenship.

**Do I need an immigration law firm / consultant?**

The truth of the matter is no, you don’t. You can apply all by yourself! All the tools are there, and in the age of Google all the information is there too. This simple guide and the following posts should be enough to shine some light on the process. The transparency in regulations of these foreign governments allow for anyone with internet to access almost any type of information on their laws, processes, and changes.

Clients approach law firms when they want a professional with years of experience to handle the case for them. There are many reasons to hire an authorized firm:

Firms know tips & tricks that come with years of experience. They ( genuine firms ) have thousands of successful cases, infrastructure, staff and knowledge about every aspect of immigration. They are recognized by the governments of the country in question and also recognized by the local embassies and consulates of that country. Authorized lawyers can fight cases that are difficult. Even though you must never lie to the government in your immigration application, regulated and experienced law firms know how to “bend” the case, what parts to shine a spotlight on, and where to cast a shadow.

Finally, they have access to things like the national job bank where you can search for a job while you wait which could greatly speed up your ITA, and access to submit your case in PNP channels which are not usually attempted by candidates due to lack of information or complexity. Some clients don’t want the stress of handling all that, some clients simply do not have the time.

———————

If this post gets enough attention, I can commit to a few future posts regarding:

PNP Nominations, what are they, how do they work?

How can you improve your CRS score?

Any other FAQ’s

Maybe an AMA?

I hope this has been enough to clarify a few things. I am available for questions, clarifications, and any support that is required via DM. I wish you luck and good fortune in your adventure to a new country and a new life!

Sincerely

689,submission,gzt3nk,2020-06-09 22:37:49,"Just got threatened by a seller on Dubizzle. I and my dad are just coming off this horrible experience with a seller on Dubizzle.(TL;DR at the bottom)

So, we were looking for a second-hand washing machine after our 8yo one short it's board. So we came across this guy who was selling a  AED 1500 Daewoo washing machine which was barely used for Dhs500. Dad thought deal was good and enquired. First call itself, dude sounded very rude. When dad tried to negotiate(delivery charges included since the item in question is in Dubai and I live in Sharjah) ....he asked if he was joking and he is only looking for 'serious buyers'. We hung up the call saying we'll talk later.

After further searching...we decided to call him again and ask him whether he can provide any sort of guarantee. Dude says he'll give me six month guarantee and if not he'll give another machine (very suspicious to begin with). We ask him to tell final price along with delivery and he asks for location for clarification. I sent him location ( big mistake from my part) and dude says 'OK!' and hangs up.

Hours later at around 9( yes an hour before lockdown), he calls saying he's in the location and asks us to collect the washing machine. Neither we asked him to bring it nor did we confirm it. Dude WhatsApps my dad( who cleverly used his business instead of personal account) and continuously harassing and threatening him saying he'll ''call the police and come"" multiple times. He said he has call records of my dad agreeing to the deal, which obviously didn't have as he didn't even bother to send any. After several police threats, I asked my dad to to send him a message saying we'll charge harassment charges against him. This goes on back and forth

His threats sort of stopped there. He then asks to atleast pay the driver AED150(which we sort realized he is the driver and his Dubizzle ad also said that he is 'fulfilling' the delivery) which after my dad refused to do....he reduced to AED50 (this is probably a tactic for him to bring my dad face to face with him...so he can coerce him to buy it even more). This goes on and on....and finally he retreats after a final police threat, after which I proceeded to block him on both WhatsApp and on call.

The dude has the audacity to say such stuff so that he can coerce to but that washing machine of which God knows of what quality it is after that horrible experience. I made a mistake on my part sending him the location but him coming here without any intimation was the last thing I expected. Although I should've when dude was aggressive AF during negotiation.

I don't know if it's right to post the seller's name here, but if so I shall post it here to prevent others from having this experience. I have heard about negotiation crap happening on Dubizzle but this is something else.

TL;DR: Seller on Dubizzle comes to home claiming we confirmed to buy his washing machine, when denying doing so, he proceeds to harass us on WhatsApp.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.47,0,27,2020
690,submission,gztu8g,2020-06-09 23:14:22,"20-year ban for equestrian rider in horse abuse case - APNews LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) — A record [20-year ban](https://inside.fei.org/content/fei-tribunal-hands-down-record-sanction-horse-abuse-case) in equestrian has been imposed on a rider from the United Arab Emirates for horse abuse at a long-distance race.

The horse, Castlebar Contraband, was euthanized after a “catastrophic injury” sustained after being injected with a banned sedative for a 90-kilometer (56-mile) endurance race in France.

The International Equestrian Federation said the ban until June 2040 imposed on Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Faisal al Qasimi was the strongest in its history.

He was previously [banned for two years](https://inside.fei.org/system/files/BS08%20-%20HOTSPUR%20OUARRA%20-%20Final%20Tribunal%20Decision%20-%2030%20January%202012.pdf) in 2012 when a different horse tested positive for testosterone.

The sedative, xylazine, can be used to lower a horse’s heart rate and for nerve blocking to allow it to run through pain.

The sheikh was ordered to pay 32,500 Swiss francs ($34,000) in fines and legal costs. He can appeal against his sanctions at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

The FEI [suspended the UAE](https://apnews.com/428b652b4f7447c49be0595491574aa7) member federation in 2015 because of cases of doping, horse abuse and faked results in endurance races.

It's finally time to say goodbye. Dubai has been an amazing run and have thought me a lot both professionally and personally. Here are some tips and tricks for the other ex-pats from my learnings.

1. Have a backup plan:

This is pretty obvious but always have a backup plan. We planned ahead and got an Australian PR as a backup but never knew this will come in handy so soon. We reached here and have settled in. 

2. Save, Save & Save:

Save as much as possible and invest in a low-risk portfolio. You never know when things will turn upside down so it's a great idea to have good savings stored somewhere else.  I had a lot of meetings with the financial advisors who all advised about investing my entire salary on plans that benefited them the most. I decided to not go that way and invested all our savings in FD & RD back in India. The main reason being the safety of the capital.

3. Don't buy an expensive car (especially with a loan):

I wish I knew this!! but I made a stupid mistake of buying an expensive car on loan. It bit me back when I tried to sell it and especially during the mid of the pandemic. I sold it for peanuts and lost a significant amount. I did however enjoy the car every bit and Dubai is an amazing place to own a sports car.

4. Always remember that Dubai is not your permanent home:

Keep remembering this whenever you get tempted to buy something expensive or make a long term decision. This is not a permanent place and things can go south pretty fast. Always be prepared for this. 

5. Enjoy the great food you get in Dubai:

After coming to Australia, One big thing I miss is the cheap and good food options available back in Dubai. 

That's all folks. I came to Dubai with nothing and I left Dubai very happy. It's an amazing place with lots of opportunities. I just wish that Dubai has some option to make it your permanent place but I guess its a long way to go. 

Take care everyone. Be safe!!",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.96,290,88,2020

Not that age matters that much but out of 452 nominees how in the world was I the absolute best pick, I’m extremely shocked.

Love to all, believe in yourself, please. I had nothing and kept my head down and worked and this happened. 2 days of celebration and then back to keeping my down again and working. It’s the only way to success.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-12/abraaj-ex-ceo-s-theft-totals-385-million-liquidators-claim](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-12/abraaj-ex-ceo-s-theft-totals-385-million-liquidators-claim?sref=9Wxj4kTx)

Liquidators overseeing [Abraaj Group](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/545950Z:UH)’s insolvency now estimate Chief Executive Officer Arif Naqvi’s alleged theft to have cost the firm $385 million, an amount significantly more than what prosecutors claimed.

Naqvi is one of six former Abraaj executives who face charges stemming from the private equity’s firm’s 2018 collapse. In court papers last year, U.S. prosecutors said Naqvi stole more than $250 million. But in a new filing on Friday, the liquidators put the losses much higher, claiming Naqvi stole $385 million from 2009 to 2018 as he moved money for his own use in more than 3,700 transactions.

The liquidators are at work trying to trace the transactions and have asked a New York judge for permission to file subpoenas on 18 banks. The information will be used in a planned lawsuit in the Cayman Islands seeking to recover funds to pay the firm’s investors and creditors.

Abraaj managed more than 40 private equity funds and assets of more than $14 billion until it crumbled in the biggest failure for a private equity firm. Naqvi, who has denied wrongdoing, is under house arrest in London facing possible extradition to the U.S. His lawyer didn’t respond to an email seeking comment after business hours in the U.K.

Another executive, Mustafa Abdel-Wadood, a former managing partner, was arrested while on a college-shopping trip to the U.S. with his wife and son. He pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing in September. Other defendants charged in New York are outside U.S. custody.

Abraaj, which was founded in 2002, was the Middle East’s biggest private equity fund and one of the world’s most influential emerging-market investors, with stakes in health care, clean energy, lending and real estate across Africa, Asia, Latin America and Turkey.

Dubai’s financial regulator has [fined Abraaj](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-30/dubai-regulator-fines-collapsed-buyout-firm-abraaj-315-million) $315 million for deceiving investors and misappropriating their funds.

The case is In re Application of Abraaj Investment Management Ltd., 20-mc-00229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.93,26,5,2020
716,submission,h86o13,2020-06-13 16:31:29,"Be careful of financial services in the UAE This is a throwaway account, I just feel like some things need to be said regarding financial services.  


I am a financial advisor who used to work in the UK and moved over here a few years ago and I feel there needs to be more disclosure regarding the unethical practices that are sadly quite common in this industry.

The majority of advisors in the UAE have no professional qualifications and are more concerned about their comission than your investment so be very careful who you go to and always get a second opinion before you sign anything.

Things you should generally avoid:

* Structured Investment Products (Structured Notes) 

These are extremely complicated investment vehicles which are signifcantly more risky than they appear. Sometimes they work but mostly they do not.

Luckily, they can be sold so if you have any in your portfolio ask your advisior to get their current price and if it isn't at a significant loss then sell them.

&#x200B;

* Contractual savings plans, ie save xxx per month/year for xxx years that are longer than 10 years

These only work if you do not withdraw any of the money until the end of the term. They can be as long as 25 years and realistically, it is highly unlikely you will not need some of the monies invested at somepoint during the policy. 

However, some investment providers (Friends Provident for instance) allow you to convert these into bonds which is a lump sum investment vehicle in which you have complete access to all your monies/investments so ask your advisor if this is possible in your case.

&#x200B;

* Having your investment moved from platform to platform (commission is paid each time)

This is a serious tell that your advisor does not have what is best for you in mind. Get a second opinion from a different firm and change your investments over to another advisor. This is called churning and sadly it is a common practice.

&#x200B;

* Offplan Property Investments (Many of these projects are never completed)

Not much you can do really, just hope for the best.

Dubai is a city where firefighters use jetpacks, [archipelagos are built from scratch](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/the-heart-of-europe-the-world-dubai/index.html), and [buildings climb into the clouds](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/burj-khalifa-dubai-guide/index.html); a slick metropolis in the middle of a vast red desert.

Mars Science City was originally earmarked to cover 176,000 square meters of desert -- the size of more than 30 football fields -- and cost approximately $135 million.

Intended as a space for Dubai's Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) to develop the technology needed to colonize Mars, architects Bjarke Ingels Group [were asked to design a prototype](https://twitter.com/DXBMediaOffice/status/913038693325266945) of a city suitable for sustaining life on Mars -- and then adapt it for use in the Emirati desert.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.67,2,4,2020

736,submission,h9wfwt,2020-06-16 08:19:44,"Hopefully one of the few good things that comes from this pandemic is the UAE's willingness to discuss and improve access to mental health services After hearing the tragic news about numerous suicides last last week, I did some research out of curiosity to see what kind of mental health support services are available in the UAE.    

I don't know why I'm surprised, but the situation is pretty grim.    

If you're fortunate enough to have disposable income, there are a number of psychology or counselling services you can access, but these aren't covered by even the best insurance policies and cost upward of 600+ a session which is out of reach of much of the population (particularly those most vulnerable). Imagine being at your lowest of lows and having to choose between rent or food and talking to someone to improve your mental state?    

Which brings me to my next point...    

For those who have plummeted through their lowest of lows and are contemplating ending it all - what help exists? The answer is not much at all. Not only is suicide seldom discussed publicly here, but until now there have been no help lines or services for people to lean on in times of ultimate crisis. In fact, people were encouraged to ""call the police"" - what does this say about a nation?    

[I did see this](https://i.redd.it/d623278713551.jpg) earlier today (which was removed from r/Dubai because it was a photo of text but honestly, can't they just make one small exception for something so important?) - which led me to search the number to find the source and was pleasantly surprised to see it [reported and discussed at length in The National](https://www.thenational.ae/uae/health/coronavirus-uae-sets-up-free-national-helpline-to-support-mental-health-1.1021577).    

A select few quotes that stood out:

>""Having the government involved with this helpline will reduce the stigma associated with mental health and show how they can access more support.""    

>""Giving people access to a mental health first aid box like this will empower them to help themselves.""    

>""To have an option to speak with trained people backed by the government rather than just the hospital or community groups is a big step forward.""    

>""Under the current circumstances, more free online counselling services would also be a big help as people do not always have the finances to pay for professional help.""    

>A suicide prevention hotline, exclusively for Indian expatriates, is the first dedicated phone line manned by trained specialist volunteers in the UAE.    

I'm encouraged by this, but the UAE still has a long way to go in having difficult disussions about mental health and more importantly, providing greater access to those who need it.   

A good step would be subsidising it by way of government rebates, or leaning on insurance providers.    

In my home country, you can receive a course of psychology for free with most basic health insurance policies. Whether you're on the brink of crisis or just incredibly stressed out with life, you have means (and are actively encouraged) to seek assistance.    

The UAE is a young nation, and a conservative nation, but I genuinely hope one of the few good things that comes from this pandemic is recognising the vital importance to open public discourse about mental health and put the blocks in place that allows people to find help.    

And with some ~90% of the country's engine room being expats, it serves absolutely no purpose for us to burn out, get fed up and go back home (or worse).    

Anyway... I hope everyone is as well as they can be under the circumstances. Hang in there, be kind where your means allow and PM me if you want to chat or get anything off your chest ✌️",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.98,40,17,2020

I used to work in aviation and airlines may try show safe travel through safety packs or sanitation stations, but Covid is an airborne virus. Every Aircraft is configured to recycle cabin air. Reconfiguring air and thermal systems or adding filters takes a massive amount of investment and time. 

1. If you're under the weather or suspicious, do not fly
2. Do not remove your masks or ppe during any stage of travel
3. Try to keep A/C vents away from you onboard
4. Dont get pressured into queuing anywhere.
5. Avoid that one guy trying to pass time with conversation
6. If you are that guy, stop

Stay safe

Edit: (corrections) 

covid 19 is NOT air borne, but cases show airflow does affect infection 
Most industrial air systems including aircrafts and airports use HEPA filters, but there is reason for caution in every enclosed space.

Again the above points still hold true, until there is a vaccine being cautious is only beneficial.",23,"['mask', 'masks', 'wear', 'wearing', 'pool', 'hijab', 'dress', 'people', 'bikinis', 'face']",protective_wear/cultural_integration.dressing,0.5,0,22,2020

* Here since 2012
* Pakistani passport

Been fired 4 times, each time doubling my salary/commission on the next job.

To help you understand where I'm coming from, here is how I usually land a job offer:

* I ignore over 5,500 job boards (including linkedin) **[MINUS Indeed.ae advanced search](https://www.indeed.ae/advanced_search)**

* I index all the talent management systems used by companies in MENA (taleo, workday etc.)

* Once I see something fitting me, I find and set a meeting with the hiring manager. Then I try to close them. This has always worked for me. SENDING CVS/APPLYING VIA TMS ATS NEVER WORKS.

**HOWEVER**, this time, its nothing like before, because there are NO openings, fake or otherwise*

So I and everyone like me has two options:

787,submission,hgjtej,2020-06-27 04:45:37,"26 June: New guidelines for returning Dubai residents ## Residents returning to Dubai 

* **The following process applies to all residents returning to Dubai,** whether you are returning after the travel restrictions, or you plan to fly out of Dubai and return.
* **All residents must have government approval to return to Dubai.** You can apply for this approval while making your booking online or through [our contact centres](https://www.emirates.com/uk/english/help/offices/). Otherwise you can complete the application yourself on the [**General Directorate of Residency and Foreign Affairs (GDRFA) website**](https://smart.gdrfad.gov.ae/Smart_OTCServicesPortal/ReturnPermitService.aspx) directly, before you book your flight with us. You must be outside the UAE to apply.
* During the GDRFA application process, you will be asked to enter your Resident File Number. You can find this number on your visa under File. If your application is approved, you will receive an email with a GDRFA reference number. If the application can’t be processed, you can try again later.
* Check the GDRFA website to see the status of your application. If your application can’t be processed, you can try again later. Please note **our call centre team doesn’t have access to your details and will not be able to tell you your status or fast track the process.**
* During the booking process, you will be asked to enter your GDRFA Application Number.
*  Please bring a copy of the GDRFA approval email with you when you travel.
*  Every passenger flying to Dubai is required to fill in this [**health declaration form**](https://c.ekstatic.net/ecl/documents/health-declaration-e-form.pdf) and the [**quarantine undertaking form**](https://c.ekstatic.net/ecl/documents/dubai-arrivals-quarantine-procedure-declaration-form.pdf) . Both forms need to be printed and completed before you travel and handed over to Dubai Health Authority staff at arrival. The quarantine undertaking form will only go into effect if you need to undergo quarantine.
* On arrival in Dubai, you are required to take a PCR test and remain in your residence until you receive the test result. If the test result is positive, you will be required to undergo quarantine.
* You must also download the COVID-19 – DXB Smart App.  [**iOS**](https://apps.apple.com/ae/app/covid19-dxb-smart-app/id1504818399)  \-  [**Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ae.gov.dha.covid19)  
* At check-in, returning residents must declare that they either have health insurance that covers COVID-19 or will bear any costs for treatment and quarantine if required.

### Dubai residents planning to travel out of Dubai 

* Residents can travel out of Dubai providing they meet the travel requirements of their transit and final destinations.
* Residents do not need a COVID-19 test or Dubai government approval to leave Dubai. However, travellers must meet the travel requirements and fulfil the processes of their transit and final destinations. 
* Once residents are outside of Dubai, the process to return is the same as above.
* COVID-19 flight and travel restrictions remain in place across many countries around the world. We are closely monitoring the situation as it evolves, and we hope to resume services as soon as conditions allow. This includes receiving government approvals, the easing of travel restrictions, and commercial demand. We will announce any service resumption when we can. [**Find out which destinations we’re flying from.**](https://www.emirates.com/uk/english/help/our-current-network-and-services/)

By Lubna Hamdan

I know what you’re thinking: How can the founder of the Middle East’s largest hospital operator be entirely clueless as to billions in undisclosed debt and fraud in the company he spent decades building?

But hear me out.

Say you’re BR Shetty: a 77-year-old who made his billions in the UAE by setting up successful businesses in healthcare, financial services, hospitality, F&B, pharmaceutical manufacturing and real estate as early as the 1970s. You were given at least a dozen awards including the highest civilian award in Abu Dhabi by the Crown Prince himself, and the Padma Shri by the President of India. You wear the latter gold medal at every possible occasion: private dinners, corporate ceremonies, media interviews, you name it. Your reputation matters to you. Your reputation means the world to you. Your reputation precedes you. You’re one of India’s richest billionaires rubbing shoulders with world leaders. You own two floors in the world’s tallest tower, lavish villas on a man-made island and more money than you could care to count.

Why throw it all away to steal from your own company? It just doesn’t add up.

### Missing pieces

If you haven’t been following the collapse of BR Shetty’s companies, shares of London-listed NMC Health were suspended in February and the company disclosed a whopping $6.6bn in debt.

BR Shetty’s remittance chain UAE Exchange, part of London-listed Finablr Group, also announced previously unreported debts of $1bn, bringing the total to $1.3bn. The Central Bank of the UAE then opened an investigation after announcing it will oversee the exchange’s management operations. It’s a strange move, however, considering the bank has never taken administrative control of any kind of financial service, especially on the first day it shows up.

In April, the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), which has $981m worth of exposure in NMC, successfully applied to UK courts to have the company placed into administration. NMC was then subsequently removed from the London Stock Exchange. But it’s another strange move by the banks – when did ADCB or any other UAE bank ever move that fast? More importantly, why didn’t the banks ring the alarm earlier? They’re not exactly the easiest to deal with. It could take weeks before they approve a large transaction, let alone loans of that size.

### Blame it on who?

The blame has largely been put on BR Shetty. In March we reported that BR Shetty had flown to India as legal problems mounted in his UAE-based companies. Sources told us there was at least one active legal case against him personally.

In a strongly-worded statement, he vowed to clear his name and said fraud committed against his companies “appears to have been undertaken by a small group of current and former executives at these companies”. He then told The National he is “really sorry” for the fallout of the company’s collapse, and that the banks have “without any proof” frozen his accounts.

“As a result, all my other companies are suffering,” he added. “Even NeoPharma, the \[salaries\] I can’t pay because of the blockage of the funds.”

Now that doesn’t sound like someone who has stolen from his own company. Why apologise for not being able to pay salaries? Why even have salaries on your mind? Surely you’d be thinking of saving yourself, and yourself only.

I’m not saying BR Shetty is entirely innocent. But at worst he is negligent. After all he was a non-executive chairman who probably wanted to retire somewhere on an island – or the Burj Khalifa. He lost his executive power in 2017, when everything went wrong and the company started racking up subsidiaries which he himself had blocked beforehand. Why is nobody talking about this?

Where were the advisors, auditor, regulators? Where was the board? It’s impossible for a board to miss billions in loans. The cashflow is too big. To approve $100 in freelance budget for Arabian Business, I have to go through at least three people. How did billions get past a massive finance team? This is bigger than BR Shetty. There are more people involved. Sources also told us BR Shetty has personal guarantees against all his companies with all these banks. If they default, he pays everything. Why take that risk of bankruptcy?

It sounds like his biggest crime was not paying attention. But if paying attention is a crime, then aren’t all the parties involved guilty?",1,"['dubai', 'uae', 'arabic', 'people', 'sharjah', 'country', 'abu', 'dhabi', 'emirates', 'like']",uae_cities_region,0.6,3,4,2020

Therefore, we'd like to clarify the following about posting news onto r/DubaiCentral:

*Only post news with a source. We understand that paywalls are annoying, so post the link (as-is and unedited), and copy+paste the article as a comment if you so wish.*

*We will not allow the copy+pasting of news without any source (either in comments or in the post directly) and the post will be taken down as spam.*

We really depend on your opinions and reactions to keep this sub as a community and as a place where everyone can come together. Therefore, we request you to **report** any rule-breaking and we will handle it as soon as we can.

If you want to escape in an striking city-break, you don't have too many options, because you can't get too far in an extended weekend. Until the invention of teleportation you can consider a trip to Dubai; a place detached from SF movies, famous for shopping or the beach, but not only.

Indeed, Dubai is full of giant malls that enchant the eye and pocket of tourists. But leaving aside the materialistic temptations, Dubai hides tourist attractions that will enrich your travel album.

On a holiday here you can walk for a whole day through the Bastakiya district, one of the few remaining places in the old town. You will stop from time to time to admire the restored buildings and visit an art gallery. Or enjoy a fresh pomegranate juice in one of the nice cafes here. A unique goal is the traditional markets, called souks, somewhere you will live a unique experience.

**It is worth admiring Burj al Arab, the fourth tallest hotel and the only 7-star hotel in the world.**

It sits in the middle of an artificial island, connected to a beach by a suspended highway. Meanwhile, its height of 321 meters was exceeded, but its greatness remained untouched. Therefore, it is still regarded as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world.

Burj al Arab was designed by British architect Tom Wright and has the shape of an Arab sailing boat called a ""dhow"".

Another wonder is Palm Islands, the largest artificial archipelago in the world, consisting of three islands. They are called Palm Jumeirah, Palm Jebel Ali and Palm Deira and all have the shape of a palm tree.

If you are more adventurous by nature you can fly the balloon, you can go on a desert safari adventure, a camel ride, or a sandboarding session.

If you still get here, you can also run to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.

We are only talking about the largest, but also the most populated and richest of the cities of the Emirates.

**Here you can visit the Sheikh Zayed Mosque, a fabulous white marble mosque, newly built, with 82 domes.**

And when you feel overwhelmed by so much concrete, steel and glass and you want a few hours in the middle of nature, head to the zoo, near the beach.

Or enjoy the coolness of Creekside Park, a huge green garden where you can admire over 280 species of plants.

The list of curiosities continues because in Dubai you can spend half a day on the beach and the other half on the ski slope! You won't even feel that it's not a real snow slope, but an artificial one located in a mall!

Dubai is a city of contrasts where you have so much to do, see and buy, that you will most certainly want to come back.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.57,2,0,2020

As you might already know, when it comes to salaries and packages we see a very wide discrepancy. I do not want to get started on how everyone has different opinions, different salary expectations, and the huge fake talent issue going on right now.

To be very short and precise, I would like to get opinions from well established professionals here in Dubai, preferably in the Software/Tech/AI/IT/Engineering or related fields.

How much would one, holding a Bachelor and Master degree in Software/Computer engineering from USA, publisher of several AI/network security research papers at IEEE, creator of many commercial software and apps, owner and manager of several websites, GCC national, expect as a salary for any of the related tech positions (AI/ML, IT/ISEC, and pretty much everything related to technology and software)?

&#x200B;

**Al Romansiah** \- perfect food. Location was also a bit fun sitting on the ground, lol, very new to me (and painful at times, need to get used to it). We order 3 or 4 dishes - everything tasted amazing. They had to roll me out of there. Not sure who recommended this ( i will find your name in the other topic and come to thank you), but this was one of the best eating experiences I've had when it comes to discovering and tasting.  

Mixed grill / kibdah - kalawi / meat nashif / chicken biryani  (portions where waaay too big)

**Bosporus Turkish** \- attempt to eat shawarma here. Doner and doner wrap. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this place.  After we left our first dish, we asked for a second dish, and had to just stop eating. Completely tasteless. It's almost amazing that this thing had cheese, meat , and other ingredients and managed to have completely zero taste.

Allo Beirut - we had to wait 5 minutes, so we were jumping up and down in anticipation, food was going to be great. We tried shawarma again... disappointment of the year. This is not what shawarma is supposed to taste like. My wife tried something else and just left it as well. No good.

Hey everyone, hope everyone is doing well and staying safe.

I'm asking this because honestly I am kind of confused about how to continue moving forward in my life and career. But I basically graduated college last year as a 3D modeller and didn't see a path in UAE so currently I switched to graphic design, did a few internships and freelance work and now I don't really see it taking off so much, maybe because I'm blocked mentally or something idk. And currently feel useless at 25 years old to be honest.

I still do it for fun but I'm just wondering if it's too late to change careers and what direction to head in. My main goal is to enjoy what I do but at the same time keep learning and try and provide some finance towards my family and the house and try to help out. So I was wondering if there is a different career that's more potent and highly required in Dubai. A friend of mine suggested UI/UX Design but not too sure about it again.

But this has been really bugging me for a while.

I mean, people are claiming that they do not have money to afford the rent, so that means demand is decreasing, right? And by nature when demand decreases prices should go down in order to earn at least something, right?

Yet it is not happening, because in my experience as well, my family and I had to move out of Dubai due to corona-virus affecting our income, and sure, there was a leeway of at least a month but after that it was back to business where the landlord demanded full payment, no installments.

And I kid you not ladies and gentlemen, the apartment of the building we previously lived in, was like 70% vacant! There were 6 floors with at least 10 apartments in them.

Despite the volatile market, and corona-virus the rent barely budged.

So why is the rent not decreasing? What am I failing to understand or see here? I understand that in the end, the managers of the real estate get to decide what rent to charge but surely by now they must realise that people are moving because it is too expensive, and that new tenants will not come by so easily.

My first attempt was a legit fail because I didnt come to a full stop at a Stop sign (even though it was Al Quoz and the stop line was completely faded) and even the second failure was somewhat logical (a person was just trying to enter the road in the lane in which i was driving, i tightly squeezed by and the instructed said I should have pressed the horn) but this time it just seemed like the supervisor was having a bad day. He asked me to check the speedometer that was I even going the limit (I was going 38 in a 40 area, I told him that) then he looked for the next time I braked and said look at that you're driving at 25. Repeatedly told me to drive faster when I could see vehicles down the road infront of me and I would start to slow down. In the end, even though I didnt make anything which required his intervention he chalked up 4 major violations (which included failure to check the lane if it was clear and I did not face a single lane change instruction the whole way, didnt even get onto the main road for more than 2 minutes and a failure to follow traffic signs) and 17 minor ones (my previous two attempts were nothing like this, and I haven't received much instruction from the classes I took either who told that it was just fine if i drove like that). The supervisor was rude, and at the end when I was about to go back to the center he again berated me on being slow and used his pedal to accelerate the car like he was Dominic Toretto. Honestly from the start he just felt like he was annoyed at something and I had to pay the price with him getting frustrated at normal behavior.

With the price that they charge for every retest and the pressure that comes with every failure which includes waiting for your training classes to be scheduled, carving out 4 hours in a work week to complete them and then going for a 5 min test where if the supervisor woke on the wrong side of the bed then he would make you pay for his troubles, I'm really wondering whether I should just give up all hope of trying another time. I know this might not be everyone's experience and there are people who'll disagree but its so depressing. If anybody has any tips, or advice or any constructive criticism even I'd appreciate it. Also should I just give up or try another time because its screwing with my mental health a lot everytime I fail.

I have never visited before so any advice that you don’t find online - little life hacks or things to ease my transition when moving would be fantastic. I think my school have a good induction period but I am looking forward to exploring on my own.

People will ask why I dont do the DPI test for 50aed. Simply this has a high “ false positive rate” (hence no other countries using it) therefore if you get a positive result, you are then required to get a swab at 370AED, so now I am down 420AED! Just to go to work and care for people!

https://m.khaleejtimes.com/videos/nation/couple-with-10-kids-seeks-help-to-find-shelter-in-dubai


So clearly when help is offered this family refuses all sorts of efforts and seems very fishy. Anyone who is feeling sympathy for them or offering them help please do your research and then offer them whatever you can. I honestly can't believe how Khaleej Times posted a video of them without any investigation. 

My dad and a few of his friends including people from the SriLankan embassy visited the family in asking how they can help. One of the helpers told the family that he will send them back and pay for their tickets, the father refused saying no he needs a life here in UAE with his 10 kids. 

Another helper offered him a land in SriLanka to build whatever he wants to settle there with his family, the father refused saying no he will only accept a land or house in Colombo. And when they tried to convince him he threatened to call the cops on everyone who had come to offer him help. 

My father being from Anuradhapura asked the father if he claims he is from that city on the video on Khaleej Times so where abouts were they from. He threatened my dad and started raising his voice, getting mad and pointing fingers saying oh you all come only to ask where I am from and refused to answer a simple question. 

But from what my dad and his friends can make out their accent is not from Anuradhapura, they seem to come from the eastern side of SriLanka. 

My dads opinion: there is a 3rd person( 13th I should say) in SriLanka with these people, trying to take money here from locals and send 50% there and 50% here. 

If a person is refusing all sorts of help I don't know in what mindset did they come here ? So taking help from arabs and locals are fine when they offer you money and food but when your own countrymen offer you help you threaten them? Hypocrites!

Just making sure people don't fall for this scam and waste your energy. There are many people out there who deserve so much more and are in need. This family isn't one. 

Save your money for a better person or better family.


Edit update: contacted the journalist named Anjana who produced this video and this her response saying that I am jumping to conclusions when asked why was his SriLankan account number been given to so many people who wanted to help but then the father refuses to go back to SL ""I think that is a claim you or I cannot price wrong. There are kind and unkind people everywhere. He does not have a local bank account and asked me whether I can give mine or the newspapers’ local count number. But we are not allowed to do that. It is in that circumstance he gave his Sri Lankan account. I can say that he tired everything possible to convince me to get somebody to help him/offer him a local account where people can send money. So...""

Let me explain 😅

I woke up Sunday with a motion notification on my internal home cam- there were three motions sensed at 3:07, 4:01 and 5:11 am. When I checked the cam there is no movement, however there is a very strong light source flashing what looks like Morse code. 
Although the footage is dark because it’s the middle of the night, what the footage shows is a light flashing from underneath my coffee table in the living room.

I live on Dubai marina and I have spent all day checking the footage and can see no reflections through the window that the light is coming from outside.... the light source is definitely primary and is inside. It also is quite sporadic, not consistent and which is why I think it might be a code. 
I’m usually not sceptical but I do tend to lean towards science explanations over paranormal, however with this, I am stumped. And believe me I’ve tried every possible explanation it could be, but I can’t find any.

The 3:07 footage is here ...
https://imgur.com/gallery/bgGQBuK

I’ve posted images here of the daytime views for reference and to show there’s nothing on, under or around the table that would make that kind of light : https://imgur.com/gallery/cMhk85h
My friends father is a pilot who has identified lettering based on a small clip, so I sent him everything to check and I’m hoping some paranormal fans or foes may help me with some of their ideas, so if anyone has any theories or explanations I would be greatly appreciative 

EDIT : I setup a secondary camera to film from a different angle (behind the light source facing the coffee table) and yesterday morning I woken
 up to 0 activity all night on BOTH cameras. 
Scrolling back through the timelines, it shows that this happened for 2 consecutive nights, both on 3 occasions. I realised that I only received the movement alert on the second night because my camera setting was set to Away after going out for dinner earlier in the evening- but was set to Home the previous night.


EDIT 2 :
Went to bed last night and before you all moan at me, yes I forgot to turn my tv off 😂) - within 3 minutes I heard a noise so decided to check the cam from my room and there’s two orb appearances.

994,submission,igzoat,2020-08-26 18:18:14,"NMC Health Faces Advisory Fees of $140 Million for Bankruptcy The restructuring of [NMC Health Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NMC:LN) through an Abu Dhabi court could cost as much as $140 million in consultancy and legal fees, almost half of what the hospital operator’s administrators are raising in new funding from creditors.

“It’s not cheap and we have the best advisers and the best minds in the world working on the preservation of this business,” acting Chief Executive Officer Michael Davis said in a recent interview. “If you look at the amount of money that has gone to other parties or that the company has lost, this is money well spent.”

NMC’s court-appointed overseers are applying for bankruptcy proceedings through Abu Dhabi Global Markets, the financial center of the United Arab Emirates capital. They’re doing so as the company’s complex legal structure across different geographies makes it more efficient to oversee the process in one jurisdiction, where the bulk of its operations are based.

Founded by Indian entrepreneur Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty, NMC had a peak market value of $10 billion on the London Stock Exchange before the uncovering of billions of dollars of undisclosed debt pushed it into administration. Caretakers [Alvarez & Marsal Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/592998Z:US) are now working on a turnaround plan that will see NMC focus on its UAE and Oman domestic markets, while selling non-core international assets.

NMC will raise as much as $300 million from creditors to fund the business during its administration. Advisory fees to drive the bankruptcy process, which could take at least two years, will probably amount to between $100 million and $140 million, according to a [recording](https://cf-cdn.nmc.ae/Uploads/InvestorRelations/all-lender-call-presentation-recording-19th-august-2020-19-aug-2020-70092873-a7f2-465e-842f-535b0b48e01a.mp4) of a conference call [last week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QFB77IDWX2QS), and available on the company’s website. It was updating stakeholders on the company’s performance.

The estimated costs would cover more than 10 advisory firms, including legal, tax and financial experts for both the company and its lenders on the restructuring and fund-raising side, a spokesman for Alvarez said. The fees would also include work related to investigations in anticipation of litigation.

Some of its other advisers include Perella Weinberg Partners, Kirkland & Ellis and Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.

“The business in the end is worth much much more than the amount of fees that we will pay,” the acting CEO Davis said. “Every single penny that has been spent has been worth it until this point.”

they just tell me please, give us time, we beg you, please.

a month ago, i ran out of patience hence my lawyers filed a ""scam & fraud case"" against the company at sharjah court. the ultimate & harshest financial case.

today was their last chance to come down & settle with me at the court & guess what? their lawyer called the judge & casually made a bullshit excuse for not attending their final hearing like it was a party. as the result, the judge is now freezing their personal & business bank accounts, shutting down their company, & banning them from exiting/entering the country, & renewing/signing/obtaining any legal documents through the central bank & dubai government. in simpler words, they're fucked to the max. ☠☠☠⚰⚰⚰

i wonder, if they're really in financial difficulty, then how have they been affording their big ass luxurious office near burj khalifa all this time? why would someone hire a lawyer for help in avoiding his dues? if they already know they can't make a getaway, then why are they resisting me? the owner can verily pay my due by selling his personal car in just a few days. all this doesn't make sense to me.

everyone around me who i asked for their opinions on this is also preplexed just like me except a few & those few are telling me they're buying time through their lawyer for cheap so they can abscond sucessfully just like most owners of failing businesses in uae. however, i doubt this & here's why....

the company has 3 owners. if 1 owner absconds, other owners will have to pay & if all owners abscond together, their company's local sponsor will have to pay. 
my wastas fetched me intel on the company & i found out one of the owners is born & raised in uae & his family have been here for generations & that makes it impossible for him to abscond. worst above all, they're getting banned from exiting the country next week. 😎

i can't fathom the real reason they're self destructing. 

what's your take your on this? why do you think they're doing all this? what are the possible endings? any cases similar to mine? what are the loopholes in the system they can use to avoid paying which i'm not aware of? 


for more information, feel free to ask?

Talked to the owner a bit and felt bad for him. His sales were low. The economy is bad its hard for him to make ends meet here in Dubai. So I purchased a lot of essentials for him to make it up. I decided I would shop more at small businesses. There is no need to shop at lulu or carrefour. Our minimarts are pretty amazing most of them. They have pretty much any groceries etc you need. Please help them out here and there maybe make a couple of small purchases at their place as it is cheaper and helps them out too. Not those billion-dollar companies they do not need you at this time.

I also get some food from small restaurants please support them also they are dependent on you also. Please do not go to those expensive restaurants or those extremely crowded ones.

I am a structural engineer and I have been studying personal finances for a few years now. It's time I put that to use and start helping people in need of a financial coach.

I have been through some tough times myself in Dubai and those times have pushed me to learn about my finances.

I am not selling anything, I am not charging anything, I just want to help them get out of financial issues.

I can talk to you for 30 mins on a zoom one-on-one call.  Let me know how I can help you all. Best of luck in these tough times.

EDIT:For those of you that are asking for Key principles, I was offering a one-on-one discussion because everyone is financially in a different  situation and needs a tailored approach to their issue. But, in general the following points should be used  as principles to achieve financial happiness:

1- Live WAY below  your means. I know you have a big salary and you want to show it to your friends and relatives  by buying a new audi  but if you do not have money to buy the  car in CASH, you CANNOT afford it. Buy a 4 year used reliable car.

2- You do NOT deserve a vacation unless  you have 6 months of expenses as emergency funds in your bank and you OWN the apartment. Till then, save your vacation money every year to buy one so that you wont  have to pay that rent (the biggest expense) [explanation in comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/ikh6e8/helping_people_with_their_finances/g3l0oq8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

3- DO NOT  get into credit card debt. Its NOT normal to be forever in debt. If you play with fire, you WILL  get burnt. Its only a matter of time. There will be tough times and if you  have credit card debt to your name and tough  times arrive, the collectors will not stop knocking your door.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.96,313,85,2020

1059,submission,isp4cj,2020-09-14 21:07:00,"Life as a Freelancer in 2020 (rant) I've been a freelance photographer in Dubai for 8 years, but damn. This year has been hell. I haven't had a single commission since February. There are some rare inquiries, but they never get anywhere. 

But over a week ago I got a text from a potential client. He bought himself 15 tailored suits and wanted some fancy lifestyle shots for it. When we were discussing the project he sent me pics of vogue models and was like ""like that!"". At first I was worried that he doesn't know the cost, so I asked him 3 times about his budget and all he said ""budget is not an issue"". I told him that it could go upto 8-10k and he was okay with it.

So I set off to work. I booked an assistant/stylist, I arranged for some extra gear, and then started calling resorts and yacht companies to check all the rates and plan a 2-day shoot. I also went location scouting around Marina, JBR, City Walk, The Gold Souq and DIFC, kept him updated about what scene would work best for each outfit, time of day and try to squeeze together a very busy 2 days of shooting.

After a whole week of working on this, endless calls, emails, and meeting with two resorts marketing teams to arrange for the shoot, I noticed that he just ghosted me.. I gave him a day, still nothing, a reminder text.. he reads it, I get the double blue ticks, but nothing..  I call, he doesn't respond.. and then he texts me with ""not now, maybe cancel"".. I asked if it was a delay or cancelation, and he was like ""cancel""... just like that.

I think the biggest mistake I made was not charging him 20% prior to doing all that work. It's so demoralizing. It's not like I'm not having a hard time as it is already. I have less than 200 dirhams to my name and I always worry about where my next meal is gonna come from. And then comes this guy acting like an entitled brat who just uses people and then tosses them away for no reason.. 

Sorry for the rant.. I just needed to vent.",25,"['job', 'jobs', 'experience', 'interview', 'work', 'cv', 'school', 'looking', 'hiring', 'years']",employment_opportunities,1.0,43,32,2020

Millie (pictured on the right) has not returned home for over a day now. I'm really worried because she usually goes out for a few hours at most. I hope you guys can help me find her. :'( 

This is around Noor Townhouses, Town Square. She has a black collar, a bell, and she's microchipped. If anyone has any advice or has seen Millie, please send me a message. :( 

Thanks everyone!

EDIT: Don't think I uploaded the picture correctly. Here it is: https://imgur.com/f27dEHH

UPDATE: Millie came home! Thank you everyone!!! 😭❤️ I think leaving her toys and some of my things outside worked. I went out with a friend looking for her and she was there when we got back. I could not believe it 😭 she doesn’t look hurt or anything. I’m beyond happy and grateful to you all. My other baby Max is even happier. He was not himself all day 😭

I honestly don’t know what to say. I’ve gotten messages from people working at Town Square, a radio station, and all of you here. I’m speechless and I feel greatly indebted to everyone. I’m sorry for taking time to get back to your messages, it’s been one of the worst days for me and I could not sit home and not look for her. 

This community has shown unimaginable love and support and I wish I could repay you all. Thanks to each and every one of you. I feel like I need to type more and express myself better and that no matter what I say it wouldn’t be enough. And it wouldn’t. My brain was so foggy those past two days that breathing felt a bit difficult. I know this might sound strange to some, but this is honestly how I felt. I’d look at my yard every time I hear a sound. Just thank you thank you thank you for your time and effort. Millie will sleep safely and comfortably tonight.

Following another topic, I found it interesting to hear the different points of view when it comes to citizenship. I would like to challenge each one of you reading this to an exercise with the following premise:

&#x200B;

YOU are the ruler of the UAE. (forget about India, Uk, Pakistan, US, Europe, ...). You are not here temporarily and leaving in a few years because you're just here for the salary. For the sake of this topic, you are the ruler, once again.

YOU have to deal with the issue of immigration and citizenship, being the leader of these emirates. On the one hand you have immigrants (that's all of those without an emirati passport for the sake of this post) coming from all over the world helping you build your nation, wanting to belong and on the other hand, you have your subjects, your local population that looks at you to protect their standard of living, their way of life, culture, ...

Your job is not to look out for india or pakistan or any other place; you work for the emirati people, that's it. Your vision is to continue to build the UAE to excel and become nr1 across the board. 

Now you're presiding a committee that looks into citizenship for immigrants and you've heard all the pro's and con's - how would you shape the path to citizenship, if any? What would be your policy, your rules, to whom would they apply, what are the conditions?

&#x200B;

In addition to work permits for those working in government and semi-government sectors, permits for those wanting to enter the nation's healthcare, transport and sanitation sectors have also been released. The families searching for domestic workers, along with them, will process the permits. The Federal Authority for Identification and Citizenship with the National Emergency Situation and Disaster Management Authority made the announcement on Monday. 

In the earlier announcement, the work permits for those working in the country were already extended. Also included in the guidelines released by the authorities was the guarantee of work permits for Housemainda.

Issuing work permits would make it easier to get jobs and work here for people who are looking to work in the country. It is basically a document that allows an outsider to legally join, work and remain in the country for a certain period of time. 

These work permits normally allow the migrant to work for two months, after which the employer must change the status of the employee to a residency visa, which usually requires him or her to remain in the country for two or three years. After the coronavirus pandemic, the work permit was restricted in March. 

As for the spread of the virus in the world, 932 new cases of Covid-19 coronavirus along with over a thousand recoveries were confirmed by the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention on Monday. The UAE government is being praised for rising the number of tests that went up to over 88,000 yesterday, considering the spike in cases.

1154,submission,jh6784,2020-10-24 13:39:50,"Why restaurants are closing down... [u/leqadayi](https://www.reddit.com/user/leqadayi/) posted a list of restaurants that have closed. As a restauranteur, I'd like to give you all a detailed insight into why this is happening and why the restaurant industry is on it's knees.

&#x200B;

Even before covid-19, the restaurant industry was struggling with costs and competition. Dubai has one of the highest density of restaurants in the world per sqkm.

Did you know that 50% of the restaurants revenue is generated by delivery? With the introduction of 3rd party services like Zomato and deliveroo and talabat, the restaurants highly depend on them as they spend millions upon millions to acquire you as their customer. That was good as long as they used to charge 5% in commissions which restaurants would consider as their cost of marketing.

&#x200B;

Soon, that 5% became 10 and then 15. These companies then started offering last mile delivery services which took the load off the restaurant for keeping high paid staff for delivery not understanding that they were succumbing to giving up their most treasured possession. Their customer.

&#x200B;

Once the customer migrated their loyalty to these 3rd party services, these services started pushing restaurants to give discounts to the customers to ensure they remained with them and did not go other aggregators they were competing against.

&#x200B;

Now keep in mind none of these aggregators like zomato or talabat or any other are making money. Their value only depends on how many people they have that use their service.

&#x200B;

At an average these services charge the restaurant 30% commission on an order. That means if you are ordering from a restaurant for 100 AED, they only receive 70 AED. Additionally the marketplace has become so discounted that there is an additional 20% that goes which means that the restaurant only received 50 AED.

&#x200B;

As the rule of thumb, the cost format of restaurants goes this way:

25% of their cost goes to food and packaging

25% goes to staff.

15% - 20% goes to rent

10% goes to Heat light and power.

10% goes to Government costs

5% goes into maintenance and upkeep

That means at an average a restaurants makes 10%

&#x200B;

At an average now, 60% of the business comes in from aggregators. This means that they cannot cover costs which start to mount up.

This means that out of 100 AED, they receive 70 AED when the costs are 90 AED. With covid 80% moved to delivery which means they received even less money.

&#x200B;

Additionally the money that used to come in to the restauranteur, is now held with the aggregators which means that the restaurant owner has no liquidity to pay off their landlords and suppliers.

&#x200B;

The restaurants that embraced tech that created their own digital platform for ordering have done better than most that are completely dependent on these aggregators.

&#x200B;

In short, If there is a restaurant that you love and want to see succeed, order from them directly. They need you more than you realize.

It goes without saying that the Emiratis are a source of innovation and creativity. The pandemic has simply succeeded in stoking their imaginative ideas. Just try these wonders: Ateeq Alsuwaidi, a young Abu Dhabi Emirati photographer and astrophotographer, has created a robot that can be used to stop the spread of coronavirus in the country in the sterilization campaign. A volunteer with the Emirates Red Crescent, Mohammed Saeed Sultan Al Kaabi, a UAE national, built a solar-powered sterilization corridor that can be used at mosque gates or homes to restrict the spread of COVID-19.

Among other inventions, Emirati inventor Ahmad Abdullah Majan has designed a smart sports helmet and a smart elderly crutch. Young Adeeb Al Blooshi is another genius, who has built on numerous innovations, including his father’s prosthetic limb and his mother’s housework robot. Talking of robots, Hamad Issa Al Marzouqi, a biomedical engineering student at Khalifa University, has succeeded in innovating nursing robots that perform multiple nursing duties. A robot that tracks vital signs in the human body is among them. This is the first step in the implementation of an automated nursing system and the key to building a system of artificial intelligence for the country’s health sector. Before being examined by a doctor, the concept behind the robot is to speed up preparatory tests on a patient and ease pressure on the nursing staff so that the robot conducts an essential part of procedures at medical centres. Al Marzouki clarified that before the physical test, the robot monitors the health symptoms that a doctor or a paramedic wants to know. Those signs indicate the body’s basic functions, including temperature, pulse, breathing, and blood pressure.

It accurately tests all of these in the patient and directly passes them to the specialist doctor to improve the process of diagnosing the condition of the patient, he added. If an abnormal vital sign such as excess weight, elevated blood sugar and other symptoms is found, the robot ‘s second duty is to provide medical advice while the patient is waiting. He added that the “Medical Kit” for permanent health care is among his inventions in the health sector.

This bag enables access to the doctor by the patient in the best and easiest way. It offers instruments to calculate at any time the vital signs that the doctor wants. In addition, the bag is fitted with a medication kit and a device that alerts the patient to take the medicine at the prescribed time and to directly contact the doctor at any time, so that he can provide the patient with medical treatment at any time, Al Marzouqi added.

Digitalisation  will help create the collaborative and proactive delivery models of  healthcare services needed in the United Arab Emirates and across the  Middle East to address post-pandemic challenges, stakeholders in the  sector have announced. A recent organization by the Dubai Economy  Department also discovered that if it addresses a few key pain points,  the emirate could help test these services within a smart healthcare  ecosystem.

The workshop found, in particular, that  the UAE needs to develop strong digital and hybrid healthcare  frameworks and ethical policies, while attracting increased investment  in medical research and development in the region. With 80 percent of  medical and pharmaceutical products being imported into Dubai and the  rest of the Middle East, pressures on healthcare costs remain high. In  the meantime, the models of public-private partnerships (PPP) will  require considerable attention to be able to function seamlessly as  regional models of health services shift from traditional, face-to —  face approaches to hybrid and digitalised solutions.

Specific  areas of action include improving the caliber of Dubai’s healthcare  system, tackling potential over-billing of patients and payers, and  transforming the doctor-patient relationship from home-based to  visit-centric. Mohammed Shael Al Saadi, CEO of corporate strategic  affairs at Dubai Economy, said, “Dubai has great opportunities to  further capitalize on the digitisation of healthcare, and I am  encouraged to see many ideas on how Dubai can be the test bed for new  digital healthcare innovation and new business models.” “It would make a  huge contribution to the future-ready healthcare and medical technology  industry for the good of both people and visitors.” Meanwhile, the  Emirate has also been establishing criteria for the Certificate of Need  (CON) to encourage investment in underserved areas of healthcare.  “Government and the private sector must continue to work closely  together to develop healthcare sector initiatives, such as CON, to  prioritize access to specialized services and patient experience,” said  participant Ibtesam AlBastaki, Director of Investment and PPP at the  Dubai Health Authority.

As  part of the emirate’s CovExit initiative, the healthcare-focused Future  Economy Lab is one of several being organized. The series covers  potential post-COVID-19 recovery pathways, especially in the area of  technology.

The  Sharjah-based humanitarian organization The Big Heart Foundation (TBHF)  has announced the allocation of Dh753,000 to introduce two projects  that provide emergency assistance and shelter to more than 8,000 people  affected by Sudan’s floods.

The  first initiative, worth Dh367,000, will be conducted over a three-month  period in conjunction with the World Food Programme (WPF). Under this  programme, more than 7,000 displaced people who had to leave homes as  floods rose across different states in Sudan will be provided with  critical food packages.

The first initiative,  estimated at MAD 367,000, will be conducted over a span of three months  in conjunction with the World Food Program (WPF). Under the programme,  more than 7,000 displaced individuals who had to evacuate their homes  when the waters rose in different states in Sudan would be provided with  critical food packages.

The  second initiative, worth 386,000 dirhams, is the result of a United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) partnership. It aims to  provide immediate and tailored humanitarian aid in the Sudanese capital,  Khartoum, to 1,398 Sudanese internally displaced households.

This  project would help strengthen the potential of the local community and  improve their resistance to disasters by supplying shelter and other  emergency assistance.

28y M, no history  of illness or other diseases. Not very active life style either.

I had developed fever on 24th October, following which I decided to get tested for COVID

I took the test at Aster JLT, cost was AED 250, walk-in appointment. Result came postive within 36 hours.

I called DHA after getting the report and decided to get an opinion from them on my condition.

Though next day DHA contacted me back , asking me to isolate myself and monitor my symptoms.

I informed my fellow colleagues who i recently came in contact with, they hated me for giving their names as they all had take a test and self quarantine for 14 days. I did feel like a snitch but thought that was the right thing to do.

On visiting the DHA clinic at al Khawaneej, they checked my vitals did an X-ray and blood test. Since my symptoms Ver mild and reports looked OK they gave me over the counter medicines and asked me to monitor my symptoms. X-ray, consultation , blood tests and medicines were free. The service was fast, they even asked me if I needed a quarantine facility or not.

Came home and started counted days, by day 3 , I had lost sense of smell and taste completely. My wife had also tested postive and we were together having similar mild symptoms. There was tiredness and weakness. I had cough on and off.

All my colleagues who I was in close contact with, tested negative. The only reason was all of us wore masks all the time and social distance was sort of maintained during interaction. (Masks truly are life savers as it helps to reduce transmission) I was relived to know I did not infect anyone else.

Luckily symptoms were mild all throughout 14 days , but I had known what COVID does as my family back home had also tested postive. For people above 40. The disease can be deadly. Please don’t take it lightly. I have seen the side effects on my family members and I was just lucky my symptoms were mild. Don’t ignore the symptoms. 

My sense of Taste and smell started coming back slowly on day 11, it Felt like getting your super powers back.

Contacted DHA on day 15th and since I had no fever and no other symptoms in the last 3 days, I was considered recovered.

My office needed covid free certificate so I had to contact dha again To get this certificate I had to a visit dha center again, this time they charged me 100 Aed for consultation. Apparently since my first test was done via aster , dha asked me to do a test again as they want my test result in their system sounded stupid by anyways got a retest done. (Charged 150). Result came back in 12 hours. Thankfully result is negative so I will have to go to DHA again tomorrow. The charge to get a certificate is 70 aed.

If for some reasons you feel the need to get tested it’s better to get the test done at DHA, it is the cheapest and also it would be helpful later if you need any documentation from them. DHA has been quick and easy to reach at any time and it has been a decent experience

All this while I was working from home, reading reddit playing games and keeping my mind calm.

Please be safe and take precautions. Hope we all get by this safely.

UPDATE- thanks for the awards people!!

Also it’s important to monitor oxygen levels,
I got a oximeter from carrefour website for 50 Aed.
Any pharmacy around my house was selling this for Aed 200 which was is just a rip off",13,"['covid', 'vaccine', 'virus', '19', 'vaccinated', 'coronavirus', 'cases', 'hospital', 'sinopharm', 'symptoms']",health.covid,0.98,365,87,2020

On November 7, in addition to inheritance laws, the Emirati Government introduced a number of new regulations amending the country’s civil and criminal codes.

Consensual relationships between adults will no longer be punishable, according to the new laws, just like cohabitation between unmarried couples. Sex with minors will, however, be punished by the death penalty. In addition, the new laws abolish the license required in the past for individuals to purchase alcohol that has been available for several years now in stores and restaurants. In addition, the new laws will give UAE residents the opportunity to choose between having the divorce and inheritance laws of the country, all based on Islamic laws, or between those applied in their countries of origin, allowing different groups living in the country to live according to their own rules.

Moreover, the new laws will give UAE residents the opportunity to choose between having the country’s divorce and inheritance laws, all based on Islamic laws, or between those applied in their countries of origin, allowing different groups living in the country to live according to their own rules.

These legal changes were linked to the country ‘s attempts to be more “expat-friendly,” particularly as the Emirati economy is set to recover after rough months following the outbreak of coronavirus, which caused oil prices to drop sharply since last March and paralyzed the tourism industry.

As a result, social reforms in the UAE were designed to attract foreign expertise and investment, as the country is planning to focus on diversifying its previously oil-dependent economy.

I ordered two açaí bowls from Acai & Tribe via Deliveroo this morning, at 09:31 a.m. to be specific, and after  3 hours, my order is still not arrived. (currently it is 12:29 p.m. Dubai time).

I ordered it for breakfast, it is lunch time now!

I called Deliveroo 3 times after the first hour of the order, no resolution. They said, driver will call me, no calls.. Deliveroo was supposed to contact me, nothing (except they called and I was on another call and could not reply, nobody tried calling me back in let's say, 5 minutes).

Finally, I contacted them via chat, after more than waiting for 2 hours for the order and wasting my time over the phone, and they told me that the driver was lost etc. I said I am not interested in details and they asked me how they can compensate. An open ended question. Long story short, I said they can redeliver, refund the order and add credits for future use. Because I see three main issues here:

1. Delivery is still not with me, it has been almost 3 hours now.
2. I called Deliveroo 3 times, still nobody called me back to fix the issue. It would not be fixed if I did not pursue and contact with chat agent.
3. As a last resort, I had to contact chat team to get a resolution. I spent almost 1 hour on the phone or in the chat to get adequate support, which was not easy to find.

Now, they are going to refund it to my credit card and will redeliver the order, but they did not agree to add extra credits. If you can not keep a word, why are you asking such an open ended question, right?

I hope I can get it at least by lunch time, so I can have the food for lunch :)

I use their app frequently and order from this place a lot, but by far, this has been the worst delivery experience I ever had in my life and customer services failed big time in this specific case, as usually it is a good experience with Deliveroo customer services.

Maybe it is time to give other apps a try, any suggestions?

Dear people, 

Please dress yourself properly when heading out anywhere, even if its just the supermarket. We live in a country that respects everyone's traditions and culture so maybe lets learn to respect their culture by covering ourselves properly. 


This isn't the west to wear croptops and sports bras out openly in the malls where clearly there is a sign that says 'please dress appropriately'. 

The security might come and tell you to cover up but ita not easy for them to come and tell you either. So please I beg you have some decency in public places. 

Do not say its too hot, we live in a country where there is more Air Condition than people itself.

Edit: I didn't say anything based on religion here until someone pointed out below about how Hijab is a form of oppression. 

And yes expats are the majority and the UAE makes it comfortable for everyone. All I said was we need to respect the country's culture and rule. Yes I have lived all my life in UAE migling with all other religions and culture as well,  learning as much as I can.  ( But it never changed my mind to think of any religion as brainwashed or Oppressed or conservative)

Here is your official statement as of September 2019: 
""Visitors to the UAE should dress modestly, particularly in conservative areas and public places like shopping malls.

Clothing should not be transparent, indecently exposing parts of the body or displaying offensive pictures or slogans.

Both men and women might feel more comfortable wearing loose-fitting clothes that cover shoulders, arms and legs.

I am currently working from home for a company in Chennai with no issues (albeit with a significant pay cut as I ""working from home"")

From January the company has made it mandatory for all employees to come to office. Already 3 people in my department whom I supervise that are working at office have contracted COVID.

No one wears masks in the office, nobody cares on the road; nothing is enforced.


The biggest issue of all is that in case I contract COVID I cant even get treatment if I pay money; because there aren't sufficient hospital beds/ventilators.


I have received some offers for companies in Dubai. I dont really care about the increase in salary.

I just need to know that I will actually get proper medical treatment if I do happen to fall sick since I have had asthma for a few years.


When I checked COVID statistics for Dubai, they seem fairly low. My father who is working there also tells me that rules are strictly enforced unlike Indian streets.

The wait time was 11 hours, so be prepared for a LONG wait, about half of which will be in your car, and the other half inside the building.

While waiting in your car, keep in mind there will be no bathroom access. You also won't have access to water and food, so bring water and a snack.

I also recommend a car charger and powerbank, so you can keep a full charge on your phone at all times.

Once you get inside the building, you will have access to bathrooms and water, but you still have a long wait to go, so keep that powerbank handy.

And an extra tidbit, if you have a severe dairy allergy, they may not give you the vaccine (SINOPHARM might have ingredients that are similar to dairy). I have a dairy allergy and they almost refused me, but since mine is mild they agreed to jab me. Twelve hours later, I'm not experiencing any issues.

Finally, please don't shout at the staff if you begin to lose patience. They really were doing their best, and the long wait time is not their fault. The demand for this vaccine is extreme, so if you don't have the patience for this, best to try in Abu Dhabi through SEHA or wait for more hospitals in Dubai to start vaccinating.",13,"['covid', 'vaccine', 'virus', '19', 'vaccinated', 'coronavirus', 'cases', 'hospital', 'sinopharm', 'symptoms']",health.covid,0.98,411,164,2020

This is not me begging, but asking you for advice as you know the UAE best. 


I don't know what to do in regards of everything. This might be a long post because I want you to understand my situation. I just want advice on how to proceed with my life. I want to invest myself into something but I don't know what. 

For the last 4 years, my father has been unemployed. We've always relied on him as our main source of income. Before his unemployment, I was in school, finishing up 9th grade, I was oblivious to everything and naive. Life was life. I had in mind what everyone else did, I'll finish school, graduate college, and find a job.  

I don't know where to start from. 

We've always lived in apartments since we are foreigners, it isn't easy for us in a country like this to get a house. My father's work paid for insurance, rent, provided a car, paid for fuel, and had a good salary. We were able to make ends meet no problem. I could occasionally go out with my friends, we could go out as a family, we could buy things we wanted. It wasn't any crazy wealth we were normal just money management. 

After he lost his job we lost everything. First the car, then the insurance, and then we got evicted out of our apartment by a court order. For 4 years we've been barely making it by. Donations, help from friends and, and some free lancing work my mother was able to do. Unfortunately now, my father is getting old, and he's not managed to land anything. And my mother's health situation makes it very difficult for her to continue her freelance work. She still does it sometimes, but her body can not handle doing it long enough to support us. 

I was able to graduate highschool July of this year. I did not feel the happiness or the joy people talk about when they graduate. It was nothing to me, just disappointed, because I knew there is more to come. I've performed academically well and I think that's the only reason that I was able to graduate. I was allowed to continue because of my performance, we still have money left to pay to the school, and it's been almost 5 months. I graduated first on my class, 98.3%, I've done my SAT which a friend paid for and scored 1120. My SAT mark isn't good because I was focusing almost everything on school, I had 3 sets exams every term instead of 2, and there were some national tests I had to finish. So it was difficult for me to put more attention towards the SAT.  I've studied a lot. The school wasn't prestigious but it wasn't easy either. I really invested every piece of my soul towards school. In 11th grade, I didn't have electricity for exams, and I did not have WiFi, so I spent most of my time in either a hospital, cafe, or a friend's house for WiFi. I managed to finish that grade and got second placd with97%. I was hoping that what I invested in school then, would pay off now, but it didn't. Because I did not perform astoundingly well. I was a normal student, my school marks are high, but my SAT isn't. And I can't afford to take the IELTS which was very important for college applications. I've done a national test on English because it was free. I've scored 1825 out of 2000, it's the IELTS' equivalent of 7ish. The test isn't recognised outside the country do there was no use for it. 

Now for college, before I graduated I was researching and hoping to get a scholarship. I got offers, but non of them covered everything, and it was very difficult for me to cover the rest and I could not guarantee it. Initially I wanted to study computer engineering, but right now I am fine with anything as long as I can get out of this situation. I've dreamed of studying in Germany for most of my school year. I don't know why Germany, but I found that there was no way I could make it because I needed money. I've looked into other countries like Turkey, Romania, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Brunei, Netherlands, and Ireland. Any country that had scholarships, cheap, or I just had family there. Nothing really seemed to work out.

I really don't know where these last 5 months went. It's depressing, I can't mention much that I managed to do.I wanted to look for work. But in this country, it was very difficult for someone like me with barely any experience or qualifications to find a job. I managed to land 2 interviews but nothing other than that. I've completed a Google IT course from Coursera because I was offered financial aid, but that didn't improve my chances much. I feel like everything is just made to suck the life out of you. Everytime I wanna do something I am met with a 100 barriers. I have to relearn everything before I proceed. And I feel like everything that I did was for nothing. It makes me wish I didn't stay up all night to study for my exams, or put effort into anything if it was going to turn out like this. 

I hope what I am saying is making sense, I don't want it to come as a lie or I am just not putting enough effort. I really don't know what I can do. I relied on my parents for everything, that's how things were, but now I am being hit by this huge responsibility all of a sudden. For my future and my family. I had to adjust a lot of things so suddenly. My brothers are home because we can't afford them education. We can not receive anymore financial help, colleges in this country don't want to cover all of my fees, I can not get a job. And anything that I will start to do now to earn money, won't have enough of a result to resolve this situation. I am willing to invest myself into anything. I am not trying to say that I won't work because it's not enough, but it's because my time is running out.

My residency ends next month, we've managed to keep it but now will probably be the end of it. In my country, we have nothing. No family, no home, no money. Not after my grandfather died. We've built everything here, everything fell apart, and all that's left is for us to fall with it. And now with Corona, things are only more tight. We could get evicted out of where we're staying any second now. 

I am not here to beg or ask for anything. Please just tell me what can I do. I recently turned 18 so at least that gives me some freedom. It kinda makes it worse because I can't be sponsored by either of my parents unless I am working or studying and I can't seem to manage to do either. Please direct me to anywhere where I might be able to study, or just something to do.  I have not prepared or expected this, and now I have to manage everything. I really don't know what to do. My brain has hit a roadblock. My physical health is fine snd I don't suffer from any mental illnesses. I am just lost. I am prepared to relight myself up to work towards something. But idk what that something is, I jsut want an opportunity



TLDR: Financial situation in ruins, parents incapable of work, were running out of time and I don't know what to do save myself and my family. How can I study and where can I work?",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.96,341,105,2020

With limited opportunities and restricted access to resources in Pakistan, my family had decided to pursue careers in the Emirates, so that I could obtain a good education. 

Being 19, its been hectic applying to universities, and the cost involved sends my head spinning. I’ve been fortunate enough to receive an offer letter from NYU Abu Dhabi! It’s been my dream school since the past two years, and I’ve tried to obtain a full ride scholarship because we genuinely cannot afford more than $10K (the fees $77K per year). 

I’ve gotten a scholarship that covers the majority of it, but my family has still got to pay $26K :( 

As we can somehow manage to pay $10k-$12K, it’s the remaining $16K that’s been the source of stress in this bittersweet moment. It’s near impossible for us to pay that, and I hate to give up on such an opportunity. I really want to know if there are organisations in the UAE that help in such situations? 

I really, REALLY don’t want us to take a loan, as we’re already in debt and trying to retire it. It’s been a tough decade here, but hey another hurdle to jump over! If anyone of you have information of any sort that could help me, please do let me know.

I helped him, called my wife to chime in (she’s good with shopping, you know). He was super appreciative which was refreshing.

January 1, 2021, Abu Dhabi will reopen the Al Wathba Wetland Reserve to the public. One of the first natural  reserves to be developed in Abu Dhabi, as a safety precaution against  the spread of Covid-19, was closed to the public. Created in 1998 by the  late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the founding father of the UAE,  the reserve is 40 km southeast of central Abu Dhabi and consists of  both natural and man-made bodies of water. It includes wetlands, salt  flats, fossilised sands and dunes, comprising a total of five sq km. It  is home to more than 260 species of migrant birds, including the Greater  Flamingo, its star attraction.

In  their thousands, flamingos flock to the wetlands to enjoy the warm  weather during the winter months, with some staying all year long. On  the reserve itself, almost 4,000 flamingos remain. Overall, there are  over 230 invertebrate animals, 11 rodents, 10 reptiles and over 35 plant  species. Visitors will appreciate the biodiversity of the wetland  reserve without destroying the habitat and the climate. In their natural  environments, a viewing platform would allow tourists to watch wildlife  closely. There are designated 1.5km- and 3km-long walking trails that  can also be used by members of the public.

The  reserve will be open to the public every week from Tuesday to Saturday,  from 8 am to 6 pm. If you are travelling through Mussafah and Mohammed  Bin Zayed City, it is on the way to the Sheikh Zayed Festival. Entry is  accessible, and all Covid-19 precautionary steps are recommended for  tourists to adhere to.

1359,submission,kr0qa9,2021-01-05 19:38:46,"Dubai Economy, expecting a 4% grow this 2021! The economy of Dubai is projected to grow by 4 percent this year, driven by the (fairly) effective response of the government to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several measures have been taken by the Dubai government to extend support to local enterprises and individuals. Between March and October 2020, it also launched four stimulus packages valued at 6.8 billion AED (approx. $1.85 billion).

Dubai, which has evolved into the MENA region's major commercial and financial hub, remains committed to expanding its economy in 2021. But this year's expansion efforts will come after its economy contracted in 2020 by 6.2 percent. During H1 2020, the UAE economy also contracted by 10.8 percent, mainly because of the socio-economic uncertainty generated by the coronavirus crisis.

The recovery and growth projections in Dubai follow the estimate by the UAE reserve bank of a 2.5 percent expansion of the nation's economy in 2021. According to the national authorities, the rebound of the Middle East's second largest economy (after Saudi Arabia) this year will be driven by a 3.6 percent growth in the non-oil sector.

1362,submission,krw1ox,2021-01-07 00:08:43,"Support delivery guys? I had an interesting experience today that truly opened my eyes to some of the things around us that often go unnoticed. One thought led to another of how obviously disparate our world is - which is what makes life beautiful in some ways - but also how inequitable things can be/seem.

I reflected all day about things I take for granted and the FWP I have to ""overcome""... So much so that I created a throw away account to post this.

**Cutting to the chase:**

1. Delivery guys are truly the heroes of our city.
2. They've always been there for us, without fail, before, during, after the pandemic. I normally get my orders within (or before) the promised TAT.
3. These guys are often seen flying up and down roads, zooming through traffic, risking their lives, all to meet their KPI's (i.e. get us our food on time).
4. We all know the range of how much they get paid, the conditions they live in and the mouths they have feed back home. Oh, and how they get treated along the way. .. the list goes on ....

**The ask:** I would like to find a way to give back to them; they are part of our community and they deserve some recognition. Not sure if anything this specific already exists (please link/provide any info, if so!)

My thoughts are two fold - suggestions/recommendations more than welcome\*:

* Community group to support them in ways they most need (mainly monetary but not necessarily. Could also be helping organize extra curricular activities, donating items, language support, etc).
* Skill building so they have some learning and development for their personal growth.

Depending on how popular this idea is, we can be as creative as possible. I know this group is a motley bunch with varied talents, resources and avenues to tap into to make things happen.

*^(\*If you are not in a position to give back for whatever reason right now, you can always do your part on the humanity front and be empathetic, pleasant and thankful towards them in the mean time.)*

***TLDR: delivery guys are heros. Anyone interested to help them, please DM me.***

addressed the possibility of new energy projects and joint ventures in the oil and gas sector.

Under its new renewable energy policy, Pakistan is currently focusing on energy projects to tap local energy resources and to revive exploration and production activities in the oil and gas sector to attract foreign investment and improve economic growth.

Pakistan's Federal Minister for Energy, Omar Ayub Khan, in a meeting with UAE Ambassador Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi, reviewed progress on current oil ventures and explored ways to further Pak-UAE cooperation in the energy sector.

'Cooperation in the energy sector will give new impetus to economic relations between the two fraternal countries,' said the UAE envoy. The Minister praised the cooperation of the UAE in Pakistan's energy sector and said Islamabad greatly appreciated its economic ties with the fraternal country.

My girlfriend has been offered a position in Dubai that will see her living there for a minimum of two years starting at the end of the summer, it is a great opportunity for her and we would love to accept it. However, we would not be able to accept the offer if I can not find a job.

I am 29 years old, from Ireland and having been in my current role as a technical support engineer for the past 5 years. I graduated with a bachelors of engineering in electronic engineering. The company I work for specializes in frozen cell storage but we are also a solutions company.  My role covers many aspects of engineering but I am mainly focused on the installation, commissioning and servicing of liquid nitrogen systems, temperature monitoring systems, 02/C02 monitoring systems,  various lab equipment(incubators, BSC cabinets, centrifuges etc.) and calibrations of lab equipment. The main areas I cover would be hospitals, research labs, IVF clinics and pharmaceutical companies. 

&#x200B;

From the research I have done, there does not seem to be high demand for these kind of jobs and any that I do find, the pay is rather low. Would anyone have any advice or even the best places to look for positions or where I might even be able to get more information on current jobs?.",1,"['dubai', 'uae', 'arabic', 'people', 'sharjah', 'country', 'abu', 'dhabi', 'emirates', 'like']",uae_cities_region,0.53,1,7,2021

It will satisfy the growing demand of approximately 50,000 residents in the entire region.

The 7-megawatt Berbera Hybrid Mini-grid Project, set up at a cost of AED29.3 million, is seen as a game changer for the region as it would dramatically reduce energy tariffs, in addition to promoting industrial growth and reducing the carbon footprint of the region.

The project was initiated by the Vice President of the Republic of Somaliland, Abdirahman Abdilahi Ismail, under the auspices of the Minister of Energy and Minerals, Jama Mohamoud Egal, in the presence of officials and dignitaries from both sides.

I live in a shared accommodation & my roomate is a 50+ Obese gentleman, he has been severely sick for the past week. I think he was sicker for longer but didn't mention it. He has all the following symptoms :

1. Severe Fatigue, can't get off the bed. Has been basically bed ridden for the past week. Slipping in & out of sleep the whole day.

2. Diarrhea - His stomach can't even handled boiled sweet potatoes 

3. Fever, cough, shortness of breath

4. Loss of taste, smell

5. It is visible on his face that he is defeated with the illness, he's become pale & eyes lifeless. 

All the flatmates have been trying to convince him to get the pcr test done but he's very pompous & has old school thoughts that it is a simple illness & eating salt will cure his illness though clearly he is broken by whatever he has.

I have been trying my best to be safe, fortunately our room is very big with more than 12ft gap from him & I have been keeping the blacony door that's next to me & room door open for cross ventilation.  With ac shut. I have been hardly spending time at home (leave at 7am & come back at 9pm) & wear a surgical mask in the common area. 

I was hoping that his condition improves or he gets the common sense to get a pcr test done in this past 1 week. But he hasn't, frustrated I have moved to a hotel room for 3 days from yesterday night onwards during which I hope he gets tested. I can't afford to stay in a hotel too long, so I hope he gets tested/get him tested. The remaining of the flatmates are also game to get tested if he does too, to make sure none of us are carriers (a few others have fallen/had fallen sick too recently but none so severely).

I want to know if I can report him to DHA & they make him take a covid test. Do you have any suggestions where I can get authorities involved as he can't be reasoned with.

Edit : I want to know if this is possible/someone has done this & what is the procedure ?",13,"['covid', 'vaccine', 'virus', '19', 'vaccinated', 'coronavirus', 'cases', 'hospital', 'sinopharm', 'symptoms']",health.covid,0.89,15,13,2021

I’ve read the news and I’m just foreseeing that UAE will mandate the vaccine for all residents any time soon. I am aware that there are exemptions to the vaccine such as  people of determination, people allergic to certain food, substance etc. 

Now my question is, would health authorities actually require you to show a proof/document saying that you are allergic to a certain food,substance etc? What if, in my case, I never went to the doctor for an allergy test but I know I am allergic to a certain food because of a reaction? So I obviously don’t have any proof. Also anyone can just say they are allergic to something even when they’re not. 

Unless they want me to eat that allergen in front of them lol. Perhaps I’m not aware that they’re already doing something related to this but I’d appreciate your answers.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.5,0,5,2021

So I drove quite aggressively next to him surpassing him and then blocking his lane and mine so that he had nowhere to go and jumped out of my car.

edited to add about the hygiene part directly from the WHO...its not luck its hygiene practices that keep you safe.

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. This eliminates germs including viruses that may be on your hands.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.
Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands. By following good ‘respiratory hygiene’, you protect the people around you from viruses, which cause colds, flu and COVID-19.

This has been ongoing since March 2020 and it's the only building I know of that continues to do that. It's completely inconvenient having to go downstairs every time you have a delivery, especially if you're working from home or have a conference call or have a guest over or have kids.

Their justification is ""health precautions"" but that's obviously bs because they're a complete disaster in other building management aspects (billing, security etc), and letting the tenants of a 700-apartment building go downstairs to collect their stuff is surely riskier than allowing delivery staff go upstairs using the ONE service lift that is dedicated to them.

I thought of collecting signatures from other tenants and handing them to the owners' association or to some sort of authority (RERA or whoever handles these matters) but I'm not sure if that will get me anywhere. I hate how they're abusing their power and I want to do something about it. 

Any tips or suggestions would really really be appreciated.


UPDATE: For those who've been taking the building's side and claiming that the management is doing the right thing towards the health of tenants, I'd like to tell you that I found out today that the building hasn't followed the recent Covid protocol update on increasing the distance between gym equipment to 3 meters.

Hi folks,  


**Please note I am on the final few countries that I've yet to find help for, so if you're seeing this post it's likely for a previous date and I'm struggling to find someone in this country.**

I'm requesting help from someone within your country to help me propose to my girlfriend. In February last year, I decided that I want to make the proposal as amazing as possible for her as I would hope, it will be a once in a lifetime event for her. I planned from February until June, which is our anniversary, then I started a 365-day countdown to our next anniversary.

In short, I'm getting a photo of a person (or people) from **every single country in the world** (plus a whole bunch of territories), to take a photo of themselves holding a piece of paper that has some specific writing on it. The paper will have 3 things on it, **a specific word, the date, and the country.** Each countries word and date are different so it's being done in alphabetical order, when added altogether, all the words will make a letter, which will end in me proposing to her.

I understand this isn't everyone's kind of thing, chirp away if you must, I can take it, but Reddit has been by far my best place to find people from all over the world (check my post history) and I know there are people everywhere that love this kind of thing too. So far I've been able to get around 190+ countries' photos, now I'm here asking for help from your country.

**To reiterate, all I would need is a photo of you (with friends/family if you like) taking a photo with a piece of paper that has some specific writing on it. You don't need to be from the country, just be in it when the photo is taken.** I can't offer much other than my many, many thanks and the promise that if you're ever in need of a favor, I will do my best to help.

I'd be more than happy to prove this is real with examples, but if you check my post history, you can probably tell it is real. Obviously, as I don't want my girlfriend to find out, I am not posting on my actual account. Also, I know a few of you eagle-eyed folk on here have noticed that 365 days is too many days for the number of countries, I have 223 countries on my list, the remaining days are photos taken in specific locations that hold a significant memory for our relationship.

*Please note; by agreeing to send me a photo, you're happy for it to be posted online - each photo will only be in the video for a brief second.*

***If interested either let me know in here or send me a DM - if you do send me a DM it would be great if you post in here too just so I don't miss it (Reddit sometimes doesn't notify me for DM's)***",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.57,0,2,2021

I often hear people needing help in building their computers or simply wanting to learn the experience and maybe be able to build their next system alone.
I can help! Head on over to my Instagram and message me there I’ll get in touch and we can make an appointment.
* We can do it together
* I can do it for you while explaining what I’m doing
* I can tell you what you need to do in order to set it all up and you DIY it. While I’m there to answer questions.

At Computer Plaza, they will put your system together, but that’s boring, so why not learn how to do it yourself?

Advice I can also give, just let me know what your variables are, are you looking for a hardcore gaming monster? A mid range system that won’t break the bank but will still give you decent performance? Or are you looking to simply answer emails and watch YouTube? I will then tell you how much on average this will cost and we can then see where we can cut costs.

At the moment I charge AED250 for the service of putting your hardware together with you.

Bring your stuff on over to my place and we get started, optionally we can set it up over at yours, but that’ll cost extra.

https://www.instagram.com/BuildYourSystem.dxb
*Alternatively you can send me an email:
BuildYourSystem.dxb@gmail.com*


**Things I won’t do:**
Custom Water cooling builds. They are hugely complex and it makes very little sense for a new comer to have a system they’d need to maintain.

Give you advice on laptops or ready build systems. That’s what Sharaf or Virgin are for.

Buy your hardware for you. I will not go and spend my own money, build your system in hopes you pay me back later.

I don’t give Software support. We will install windows 10 on your system and drivers, once your baby is running, it’s all yours, you are responsible, I can give you some advice but I’m not a System administrator.

**Disclaimer:**
I’m not responsible for your hardware, if something breaks in the process (unlikely, but I want to cover my bee-hind) I will waive the support fee, but will not replace your broken hardware.

I am not affiliated with anyone over at Computer Plaza, I know people and have my normal sources but will not get a cut from them I use Newegg or Amazon to determine how much something should cost. If they don’t offer lower prices, I can try to bargain with them but that’s all the help I can give you when it comes to cost cutting specific parts.",27,"['app', 'iphone', 'apple', 'games', 'pro', 'ps5', 'laptop', 'gaming', 'amazon', 'samsung']",unrelated_theme,0.67,1,4,2021

This is a positive 2020 experience 

I want share my UAE/Dubai experience because I am moving out of Dubai.

Fortunately I was “not” laid off and I worked from home the entire time. No pay cuts too received salary on time always. But the work culture was extremely shit. Had to literally beg for budget so that my employer can release my salary. But its fine because I learned a lot and got a much better opportunity.

This sub helped me in many ways, I got addicted to reddit only in 2020 and I love each and every moment I spent here. I live in Marina so it was a boon that during pandemic and lockdown we were at-least able to walk there or go the podium and enjoy the views. 
My relationship with my wife grew very strong and we enjoyed the time a lot. 

I really love how humble middle eastern people are, how well behaved and sophisticated everyone here is. My experience in Dubai has been the best and 2020 for me went really good and positive. 

We were able ro buy my dream TV, LG OLED 65 inches which I had to sell 3 days back coz I cant take it with me. It really helped me survive because we are total nerds.

We enjoyed the best food and gained 10 kgs each. Sad but will shed it now. We walked the amazing beach, marina, enjoyed Malls, WB world, Louvre and dis a lot of shopping. 

I couldn’t save much coz we are spendthrifts but I still made to pay off all my credit card debts and going out tension free. 

We both would like to thank the Emirati community, The Dubai communities and all the people in this sub. I wish if we could meet but may be some time.

Thank you 🙏🏾 
We will miss You Dubai 🥲

The 'Technical Programme for Planning the Future 2071' has been launched by the UAE Government to attract and engage young talented graduates from leading universities in the UAE and around the world in drafting proposals and suggestions to develop future governments and advanced societies. The initiative, overseen by the Mohammed bin Rashid Government Innovation Centre, aims to attract and engage the best young minds and talents in seeking solutions to the crucial challenges facing governments by strengthening their capacities and enabling them to deliver creative ideas and design innovative solutions to potential problems.

Dr Mohammad Abdullah Al Gergawi, Minister of Cabinet Affairs, stressed that, through the initiative, the UAE Government aims to enhance the visibility of the country as a global hub that attracts minds, as well as create a stimulating atmosphere for innovative ideas to be created and implemented and young people to be active in shaping the future. Al Gergawi said that the world's changes, especially addition to the difficulties created by the coronavirus pandemic and the related recovery efforts, underscore the importance of recognizing key future challenges that involve strengthening government capacities to meet their communities' expectations, developing information protection policies and strategies and digital privacy.

It's me again from the previous post. 



[https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/kdaye0/what\_can\_i\_do\_to\_turn\_my\_life\_around/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/kdaye0/what_can_i_do_to_turn_my_life_around/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)





I am back and much better. And it is all thanks to you and this kind community. I have managed to meet and talk to many great people. I am being offered job positions, and I am looking forward to the future once again and making plans. I received many supporting messages, job opportunities, and guidance.



Thank you to everyone who commented, messaged me, met up with me, spoke to me, and guided me. I am mentally in a much better place than I was 2 months ago. I know how things work now and I know what I want to do tomorrow, the day after, and one year ahead. I do not regret making that post at 5 AM before I went to sleep. The replies kept coming in 3 days after, and I am still seeing its effect today. 



I started doing my CCNA, learning python, and want to move into cloud or cybersecurity later depending on how I will choose to move. But it's all great. I am doing what I enjoy, I am learning, and building a network. 



When my mother used to ask me ""What will you do for the future?"" I used to say ""I don't know, whatever happens, happens."" but now, I know exactly what I will do, and what I am doing, and how I will do it, and if it doesn't work out, I know how I will respond to every situation.



I want to give a special thanks to someone who has been keeping up with me daily, I am keeping him updated, he's advising me, and opened opportunities for me. He knows who he is, and will probably be reading this post. But I also appreciate everyone else. 




New: I wrote this message a while back, but only now am I posting it. Today, February 4th, is my third day at my new job! I am working in IT support in Silicon Oasis. Everyone is so nice and I am getting some training. It is soo different from school. I am not used to AT ALL to just get up for lunch, or to just leave when the time is done. Or to just get up and use the washroom. I am used to having to ask to do anything, and they used to tell us in school that they treated us like adults. This is a lot different, but one thing school did teach me is how to get things done, mostly from over work or whatever. But here I can get things done, if it's not finished it's open tomorrow, I can ask questions, it's a new and safe environment it's all just amazing. I've been arriving early, listening, and get some simple tasks done. On my first day, I spilled a cup of coffee in the kitchen so that went well. 


I can support my family now, and at least have something to bring them every month. I don't feel too tired after work so I can come home and study to hopefully grow in the field. 


I am not sure if I can ask this but might anyone know about any side jobs you can do in silicon oasis? Something that sort of pays instantly I feel like I can get into something like that. 




So just thank you all for changing my life, and making me feel alive again. I thought that things don't get better, and sometimes they don't, but if you change your attitude it's like you're living a whole new life.",1,"['dubai', 'uae', 'arabic', 'people', 'sharjah', 'country', 'abu', 'dhabi', 'emirates', 'like']",uae_cities_region,0.97,339,79,2021

I would like to let you all know that it's my passion to do financial coaching for FREE. And, I am available to each and everyone of you for the same. I have made it my mission to make the most number of millionaires in the world (I hope this comes true one day) so that people do not have to worry about money in their lives.

It has been a while since I am doing this and since then I have received texts and calls from people who are in desperate need of help. It breaks my heart to hear their stories and I do my best to show them the way to get them out of their undesired situation.

I mostly work on one’s relationship with money, getting out of debt and to set and create a pathway to financial goals.

I am a structural engineer and I design buildings. I have been studying personal finances for a few years now. It's time I put that to use and start helping people in need of a financial coach. I have been through some tough times myself in Dubai and those times have pushed me to learn about personal finances.

**I am not selling anything, I am not affiliated with anyone selling you anything, I am not charging anything, I just want to help people live a conscious and better life when it comes to their money.**

(Just want to share this and couldn’t find some other flair)
So last evening I was leaving the parking lot. And saw a man calling the police on this 13-14-year-old kid who walks her dog in the lot (empty lot) and I see her every day so though they were talking. The moment I got near her she was crying and shivering. (For the first time in my life I saw someone’s retina shaking) and the man stopped me and started blabbering that see she walks her dog here and creates a mess and everything (i have seen cleaning it too) so I said sir I even if you have a problem why would you scold that girl? And in the meantime, I called my mum to calm this girl down. 

So this man started taking videos and photographs of my mum saying you three are together I will take you to the police. I said please do so but you first have to delete the photographs and videos. He started shouting so my mum went and asked him to delete it he started shouting at her too and the moment she got near him to get the mobile he held her hand and twisted! And dragged her for like 1-2 meters. 

I somehow got into the car from the other side to stop him. He bit me, though I somehow turned off the engine. The man comes out of the car and starts blabbering something in Arabic and punched me on the jaw. I stood there was like lets not hit back because first of all, he’s around 50 and not in a conscious state. And till the time I could realize what happened he gave me a second one. I still stood and the moment he was about to punch for the third time I lost it I held him from the collar and locked him. till the time people got the man and held him. Meanwhile, the girl faints. We called the police so they said we did not even entertain when he first called if he’s done something to you get him to the police station ( Idk why they didn’t come to the scene) anyways. 
Everything seemed to be cooling and mum dropped this kid back at her house and talked to her parents. 
In the meantime, he ran to the police station to tell his side of the story. We reached the station after like 10 mins. And police saw me in blood mum’s hand swollen. And arrested him. But didn’t file a formal complaint against him. Why? Because you need a Negative covid-19 test to enter the station. We called some people in the Sharjah police and somehow registered a formal complaint against this guy. The girl is still in the hospital. And I don’t think so she would even step out.

Tbh I've grown accustomed to the racist comments from people within my organisation. Mostly because I recognize that it comes from a place of ignorance and not mallice. So I'm not affected by it anymore. That being said, management is crap and I hate working here so I want to leave. 

So, I'm sending out my CV to all these other international schools. I am well aware of how my Indianness is going to be used against me, even though I am a near native English speaker and have a neutral (*read the following in frustrated angry voice*) and therefore understandable by all accent!!! But, I'm hopeful.

Anyhoo, I get a call almost immediately from an American school. Which is surprising. She offers me a TA position. I am an SEN teacher with over 6 years of experience. When I enquired why I was being offered a position at least 3 levels junior, she said I wasn't qualified to be an SEN teacher. FUNNY. CAUSE I AM AN SEN TEACHER RIGHT NOW. Also matched and surpassed the criteria listed for SENCO position, which is one level up. -_-

I told her I had no intention of moving down the ladder and asked her politely to buzz off. 

I know the discrimination exists. It's disguised most times and blatant all the other times. It caught me off guard. Such a shitty feeling. 

To anybody else who's been treated like they're lesser, you don't deserve it. Question it. You have no need to accept this bullshit from anybody. 

Sincerely, 
An angry but also qualified SEN Teacher.

I'm overwhelmed by the attention my post has gotten. Thank you for all the awards. Thank you for letting me vent and sharing your own stories. I find comfort in knowing that there are others I can speak to that can relate and understand. Hopefully things will change and soon. 

I haven't looked through the more recent comments but will... soon-ish-ly. 

A principal has requested to see my CV. Thank you. I will reach out to you. I'm nervous to have my CV looked at considering its come from here. But also excited cause potential feedback and opportunity. Wish me luck :)

Hello, I'm nearly completing my masters in clinical psychology from Mumbai and seriously considering a move to Dubai. It's where my mother and boyfriend live and is also where I've spent a substantial part of my childhood. However, I'm well aware that applicants with an education from white countries will be given significant preference and a better paying salary. Given that I will not have to worry about cost of living or rent for at least a few years, I'm fine with starting small but I still need to know if there's any scope at all. I have great talent for the field and don't want to waste the foundational years of my career.

Better mental health support is definitely needed in Dubai plus I have the capacity to learn the local language as well as how to integrate religion into therapy. Most importantly though, I understand and empathise with the emotional turmoil experienced by many South Asians who live there. They're the group I want to work with the most. 
But I need to know if none of this matters at the end of the day, does anyone have any insight on this?",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.55,2,22,2021

I need your advice on the below situation - My brother lives with us in our 2BHK - he occupies one room. Recently he brought his wife and kids as well - he has been sick since yesterday and doctor suggested to go for a PCR test.

As I have my kids as well at home - he decides to stay in a hotel until he gets the PCR test (24 hours for the results to come) - so if he gets the results as positive - he can't afford to self isolate in the hotel for the next 14 days and we can't risk keeping him at home with the kids around.

Will he be eligible for a self-isolation center with DHA?

Any advice on this is much appreciated!

As a new expat to UAE, I have a couple suggestions that will quickly help make this place more appealing:

1- PROPER MAIL DELIVERY, this is a concern among every expat I know. Not having a proper address to deliver mail from home is annoying as hell. Paying double shipping fees using Shop and Ship is also annoying. I just want to easily receive letters and packages from home! 

2- PUBLIC TRANSPORT, this is more for Abu Dhabi, where public transport is basically non existent. Why not use the obsession with breaking world records to build the world’s fastest and largest public transportation hub? A fast link from AD to DB would be revolutionary. Make it easier for people to move around the cities! It helps the people and the economy. 

3-won’t get into it but obv the internet and phone restrictions need to go.

To the security guard at the vaccine center who wouldn't let my parents enter as it was crowded, and he was concerned for their health. He made them sit in a quiet corner until it was their turn.

To the Taxi drivers who ferried them when I couldn't, and the facilities team that kept the centers clean so they could be safe. The government officials and IT guys that keep the system functioning.

And most of all the doctors, nurses and volunteers from all walks of life that helped them from registration to vaccination.

Today she went for her visa medical. She just finished it and came out and sent me a message saying the nurse or doc asked her to undress and go full topless.

I lost my mind reading it and I called her.

She says that the nurse insisted that she needs to do a 'visual' examination and this is standard procedure! My friend complied as she didn't really know what else to do. 

I have never heard of such a 'visual' examination in all of the 6 years I been here.

I am writing this letter to express some grievances and concerns that I personally have with you.


With summer being imminent (with some saying we never left summer in the first place), you seem to have made somewhat of a re-appearance. 

Though I am a lover of animals and wildlife, I am not benevolent, I am only human. And that means I can be and am already very angry.

Your kind has desecrated, and continues to desecrate the beautiful temple that I call my body. Your bites, the result of your bloodthirsty, sanguine inclinations, are causing me great physical and social harm.

My smooth skin, which I spend a great deal of time and money on, is left annihilated by your ravenous crusade. No part is left untouched. I sit on the bathroom, and not 5 minutes later I find 2 bites on my thighs. I sit at work trying desperately to scratch what seems to be an insatiable, never-ending itch on my ankle until it bleeds. My coworkers look at me and wonder if I have masochistic tendencies.

I have grown tired of this violence and bloodshed. Therefore I am humbly requesting that you leave me at once, and that all unnecessary blood sucking activities are swiftly put to an end.

In the event that you choose to not comply with my above request, I will be forced to deploy collateral measures that will only cause tears and hate on both sides: I will be forced to use mosquito repellent cream. 

Did I say both sides? Sorry, I meant YOUR side. 

Heed my warning lest your kind be eradicated mercilessly.

Regards,

Me

First time here. Please be gentle! 

So the good news is that I will be retiring later this year in my mid-40s! I'm pretty happy about that and can't wait to leave Corporate America in the dust!

I'm nothing special. Just a big old white boy from the southeastern USA.

But I'm looking at Dubai as a retirement spot. I've been there once (2018) and I really enjoyed it. But I have some questions as I sit at home churning away on my work computer as I watch YouTube videos of Dubai and the rest of the UAE.

In all 26 countries I've been to, I've made it a point where I am a guest in one's country and should adhere to their local laws. To me, respect means a lot and goes a long way and there is nothing more annoying on a vacation than to be around a bunch of ignorant, drunk, loud Westerners (yes, I'm an American who tries to avoid Americans when I'm abroad). I've read up on the Conservative values of the UAE and I'm perfectly fine with those, but I've seen some of the things in the videos that I am concerned about. These may sound weird but here it goes.

1) I see a lot of handholding in some of the videos; particularly by those who are of Western cultures and those who appear to be dating and not married. Why do they do this? Is it purposeful disrespect to the UAE culture? Ignorance? I mean, it's normal here, but I want to respect where I may be living so I'm a bit concerned if Heaven forbid I'm in a situation where that happens to me.

2) I see a lot of women jogging showing a lot in their workout gear. Again, as a single guy, it's nice to look at, but isn't this looked down upon by local culture? Why would someone even risk wearing things like that area knowing the potential legal consequences?

3) I see guys talking to girls. Knowing myself, I would want to be about 10 feet away from the girl when talking just to be super extra careful. Again, I want to respect the culture and those who have me as a guest in their country.

4) Is there a lot of bureaucracy such as in America when getting one's medical card and lining up services such as electricity and phone and whatever else is needed?

So pardon my ignorance on these topics. Maybe I don't know much based on my one trip. But I wanted to ask as I started evaluating places to retire to.

Hello everyone, hope you’re all doing well. This time I’m not speaking on behalf of the mod-team but on myself.

I wasn’t a founder of this sub. In fact, I was brought on only to assist in running the sub when it was new. However, since I was appointed, a lot has changed.

In recent months, I have been the only active mod on the sub. This means that the quality of moderation hasn’t been up to a standard I would personally be proud of.

Recently, we’ve had an influx of propaganda spam bots which a single moderator couldn’t reasonably handle.

I'm a university student myself and there's no way I could do it alone. But at the same time, I love being a member of r/DubaiCentral, as I'm sure a few of you do too.

I’m proud of the community the other moderators and myself created here. So I want to take the next step in continuing to grow it, which is to open applications for other moderators to help me keep our community happy.

So, if you’re interested in moderating, please PM me and we’ll go from there. An extra note - CSS skills and experience with Automoderator will place you to the front of the line, so if you have any experience with either or both, make sure to mention it!

I've noticed that there are some subtle do's and don'ts that we sometimes might not be aware of depending on where we are from.

E.g. I've been made aware that in some cultures they don't like you touching a child's head. Like where we would find it normal if the child fell off a swing or anything and to reassure them all is well, I would just pet the head. In another situation, there was a couple in discussion with me on a topic, and I addressed the woman. Afterwards I was told it would be better to always address the man.

Now, without saying any of it is good or bad, it is different. Wondering if there's situations you've been confronted with where you did something that might not be considered appropriate? or seen someone else do something that you found to be offensive, but you are sure the other person doesn't even know ..",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.83,8,16,2021

1670,submission,mcsme6,2021-03-25 11:30:03,"My opinion of Dubai Many people back home have asked me for my opinion of Dubai / UAE. Over the course of the past few months, I have repeatedly answered that I don't feel I can already come up with a real opinion. And while I still kind of feel that way, with the pandemic and what not, I do feel more comfortable sharing my opinion on this place.

First things first - 0% taxes on salary - Woohoo. Big big smile generator, and while not the reason I came here, still a very important factor in the contribution towards my happiness.

I was standing on the 45th floor the other day, looking out over the beaches and the skyscrapers and thought to myself 'My god, this place used to be a desert 50 years ago. It's beyond miraculous what has been achieved here'. 

I have taken a special interest in the blue collar workers and the conditions under which they work. From all my experiences, it seems the UAE (not specifically Dubai) has done some great work there to protect the workers and make sure the outcome is a win-win for all. Reading on this topic when I was back home, I expected to see and hear a lot of exploitation. This proved to be completely wrong. You have some subcontracting bosses (and these are typically not the emiratis/Arabs) who abuse some situations, and the system is not perfect, but all in all - great achievement.

My second observation is on racism. Racism, the European style, where people are xenophobic purely based on origin or skin-colour, does not seem to be prevalent here. Again, especially with locals. Across the board they seem appreciative of all those 'who came to help build these emirates'. Where I was surprised is the inter-Asian tensions, more specifically people from India, Pakistan despising each other and sometimes people from the same country, but from different regions. Very bizarre. 

Wealth gap - this is the field I feel more can/should be done. It's clear that there is a lot of inequality when it comes to the wealth that is being generated and salaries and benefits that are extended to employees. While I do understand the reasoning behind the fact that someone who needs to return to live in city-center London after 5 years, will need different means than someone who returns to live in a 3rd world country, the difference just seem to big and I can't shake overall assumptions that international companies are abusing this situation, exasperated by the oversupply of employees in this market.

Last but not least: long term expats/immigrants. Some people are born here, haven't seen the 'home-country' in their entire life, and are asked to leave subito pronto once they finish their education and without employment. I've had some discussions on this topics with some locals, and the points they make are correct and clear: nobody at any point is deluded into thinking that they will get permanent citizenship - the responsibility lies with the expats who are here for a win-win to make sure they plan for the future. All of that being said, the child itself shouldn't be a 'victim' of what might be bad choices/planning on their parents end. I'm not completely sure what the solution is on this topic, but this seems to be the one I find difficult.

&#x200B;

I've only been here for a year - but I'm loving the place and I'm not making the mistake of 'spending it all'. I save the majority and I plan for the return to the home country whenever that will be. That is my mind-set. 

I would love to hear from you .. opinions, ideas, mind-set, future plans .. anything. And perhaps if anything has changes in your opinion on this place over the years.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.78,21,14,2021

At the same time, the fact of eventually leaving this place as we're here on visa is not oblivion to me. So, if i might have to go back to my home country (sooner than forever), i'd just consider it as selling my old house and buying a new one. 

I keep coming across these posts and articles where people must leave the country either because their parents or they themselves lost their jobs / retired, they relocated either to home countries or as immigrants to countries providing passports etc. etc.

People say it's not permanent because they're on visa and must leave someday.

What i'm unable to get is what kind of stability do people look for when they talk about relocating country. either back to home country or another country as an immigrant for a passport?

If i was in my home country, I could lose my job there as well. i could have had to switch cities for employment there as well. switching cities and switching countries is almost the same as you gotta start from scratch, be it home or society. my friends could've left from my home country too. my business could be rented there as well and i might have had to shut shop if it ran into losses.

so the day i lose my job / business here, i just pack and switch like we switch cities. like one leaves there and comes here, one leaves here and goes there.

what stability are we talking about? am i missing something since i've had zero stability all my life? or is living in one place all your life termed as stability? means if i happen to be rich enough to retire here, i have stability here as well (lets leave this last point aside, i aint that rich and im sure majority population in the world aint either)

isn't getting to switch countries a blessing in dusguise? wouldn't it be boring to have lived all your life in one home? don't you buy new houses as the old one is too old and the new constructions have better quality? don't you switch to better/worsd localities within your home country too depending upon your finances?

just not able to comprehend the stability bit. looking to read all opinions to better understand since i'm oblivion to stability. i must leave someday, sooner or later.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.47,0,20,2021

Happens often that they come deliver something to the neighbouring compounds, so I'm just ok with it, and I typically will wait the 5 to 10 minutes if I happen to go out and some car/van is blocking my exit.

Yesterday, this guy stopped in front of my house, I saw him, but as he had a packet in his hand, i just went into my house thinking he'd be gone a few minutes later. An hour later, lo and behold, there was his car blocking me from exiting my garage. Went over to the neighbours, and across the street, nobody knew who's car this was. Honked my horn a few times, just in case... 20 minutes had gone by and I had a meeting to attend. So I called Dubai police and he literally said ' Habibi, use our app, make note of the licence plate or take picture, he'll receive an sms immediately.. if within 30 minutes he is still there we will 'lift his car'... or something I didn't understand.

Anyhow, did everything he asked. Took an uber in the meantime as to not let my meeting wait. 2 hours later when I came back, the car was still there.

&#x200B;

What would you do?

I did nothing, just went inside the house and tried to ignore it.. even if it did bother me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Crescent Enterprises’ venture capital arm, CE-Ventures, has set a target of investing Dh1 billion ($272 million) in start-ups by 2022. Since its founding in 2017, the industry has spent more than Dh500 million in 32 start-ups and venture capital funds across the Middle East and North Africa, the United States, India, and Southeast Asia. Crescent Enterprises CEO Badr Jafar said, “Our pledge to double down on new funds available for venture investment is testament to our belief in the major social and economic effect of such high-growth, tech-enabled businesses.” “We will continue to work with brilliant entrepreneurs in the Mena region and elsewhere… particularly where we can use our operational expertise and global market reach to help them scale and prosper, thereby creating jobs and opportunities.”

CE-Ventures has made investments in companies in a variety of industries, including FinTech, EnergyTech, FoodTech, and Enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service). Tarabut Gateway, Hippo Insurance, China Union Pay, Nerdwallet, and Turtlemint are among the companies in which it has invested in recent months. “We will continue to work with brilliant entrepreneurs in the Mena region and elsewhere… particularly where we can use our operational expertise and global market reach to support them scale and prosper, thereby creating jobs and opportunities.” CE-Ventures has made investments in companies in a variety of industries, including FinTech, EnergyTech, FoodTech, and Enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service).

Tarabut Gateway, Hippo Insurance, China Union Pay, Nerdwallet, and Turtlemint are among the companies in which it has invested in recent months. As businesses seek to capitalize on post-pandemic opportunities, venture capital investments are increasing. According to Crunchbase numbers, VC investments increased by 94 percent annually to $125 billion in the first quarter of this year.

Please find below my link for the study on *""New Parent Role and Work-Life""*.

 Kindly request your help to fill the survey if you are a  *working new parent with young children aged 3 and below*. Your responses would be really valuable and will enrich my study. 

I would really appreciate it if you and your spouse(if they are also working) could take a few minutes to fill this survey☺️ and support my dissertation. Please fill the survey individually. 
It would be even more helpful if you could send it to your friends who are new working parents.

I drove my Honda pilot into the sand, only for it to be stuck and not move forward or backward at all. I was trying to figure what to do, accelerating to see which way it budges. A few minutes into this, a gentleman walked up to the car. He asked me to hold on, while he dragged the sand from underneath the front wheels. A few more minutes into this, he had completely taken charge of the situation, running around to get stones, dragging more sand. Another gentleman offered to tug, but unfortunately my car had no hooks to latch on. The first gentleman magically produced a pressure gauge, released some air from the wheels and even drove it out of the jam. I couldn't have been more thankful for this timely help. Sometimes people just turn up like angels and you're stuck wondering what the hell happened. It was a humbling experience to be helped out. The only way to make up for this is to pay it forward.

The CEO/CTO was a very nice man. He understood that my money was stuck in the BTC terminal and has assured me to compensate for my losses. 

As a token of appreciation he shall be giving me some funds from his end to help me in my cancer. 

I have been using bitoasis from 2018 and have not faced an issue. I don't use binance P2P because I always trusted a UAE regulated broker more for my funds even though they have a fees that many including myself deem unnecessarily high. I have read some horror stories on P2P issues and that's why I have used bitoasis for this long. 

Lastly thanks to R/Dubai. You have helped in contacting them directly. 

I am ending this on a good note but one constructive criticism I can give them is to expland their team in helping people out. 

To a lot of traders here 70000 dirhams is a small amount. To someone like me, I can be alive on it due to my treatment. 

Lastly, I request all of you to say a prayer for me. I have stage 4 cancer with a questionable prognosis. I have been alive on prayers and live on them. 

Thanks

But I have not subscribed any such service.  Am surprised to receive the charge.  I have cancelled the subscription from Etisalat App.  But for the charge for April, I wrote couple of times to the third party support, but no response.  It is a small amount, but don't like being charge incorrect amounts.  Can Etisalat charge for a service we have not asked ETISALAT to provide.  Then any company can ask ETISALAT to charge us for something which Etisalat has no information whether it is valid.  Since the charge is coming from Etisalat, we have no direct relation with the third party and cannot hold this as separate payment.  And can find any complaint line/ email etc. on ETISALAT website.

1829,submission,nkj81l,2021-05-25 10:44:12,"PSA for people buying used cars. So you've gone on dubizzle. You find the perfect car and it's surprisingly lower than your budget. You buy it quickly in case someone else snatches it after just a cursory look below to find if anything is leaking. 

Or you go to the dealer. You check their used lots. Nice low mileage, excellent interior, all shiny and clean, with a full service history. Get a nice price, finance it easily (cuz dealer) and are happy with your new purchase. All very simple. 

Please don't do this. 

We own a garage and we've recently been getting so many customers with complaints saying they just bought a used car, or they bought it from the dealer just to find that their odometers have been rolled back, or the parts are Chinese or in one case the whole engine was way more worn than what the mileage suggested (40k kilometers needed a replacement engine lmao)

And this is from big name dealers (not gonna name names). You might think that because you aren't buying a luxury car you aren't affected, but sadly it's those people who can least afford it who are. 

So please do your due diligence and get it checked with an independent garage of your choosing (this is very important) before purchasing it. If the seller insists that everything's all right and you don't need to, just run away as far as possible.

Edit and Disclaimer: I didn't mean for this post to be advertising our garage, but since some of y'all are asking it's Focus Auto Service in Al Quoz Industrial Area 3.

It's owned by my family and used to handle corporate customers but we got shafted on payments through the last year so we're shifting to individual customers.
It'll be great help if you drop in and I promise good service.

You told me that she is one of your favorite authors who is a tv critic and related to the new yorker, after which we started talking about tv shows and stopped immediately because I told you I watch kdrama. We moved on to other topics and talked as though we were friends from a long time. We talked about the differences between your university and mine, life in Dubai and Sharjah, how sorry you felt about my almost 2 hours of commute, and how studying economics turned out to be a disaster for you.  We chatted so loudly (because we stood a little far from each other) that I am pretty sure some people in the metro were annoyed.

Your stop was before mine and I asked for your Instagram username. You told me verbally and expected me to remember it. What you did not know is that I have the brain of a goldfish.

So, if you are the girl who was reading 'I Like to Watch' by Emily Nussbaum on the metro today, please pm me because all I remember is that your username includes the letters 'r' and 'n'.

&#x200B;

Always some vague story about how my emirates ID needs updating or my bank account will be blocked. (my reaction: yes please block my bank account), or how they will send me an OTP to verify it's me (my reaction: i keep giving them a completely wrong number until they hang up in frustration) etc etc..

Either way - don't be pressured if anybody calls you and tells you 'under stress' that your account is going to be blocked, or a delivery will not reach you etc.  Just always say that 'you will visit the nearest branch to get it sorted in person'.

&#x200B;

the mechanics to understand: what they will typically do is go as far as ordering something online with your credit card details (many business here are leaking financial info so that's unfortunate) but they still need to provide the OTP at the end to confirm. So they will call you at the time that they are trying to buy and they will tell you that they will shortly send you and OTP to verify it's you (in reality they are trying to buy some expensive stuff or trying to add your card to a digital wallet). You see the OTP, you just heard that they would send it to you - chances are you will give them the OTP (even if the sms says not to share).

Another popular one is 'your package is being delivered you have to pay 2 AED admin fee' - same idea- trying to get your OTP.

A new one is that they will go on the website of dubai police - tell you they are the police and submit your number on their website, and again, you'll get an OTP which gives you a sense that you're actually speaking to whomever claims to call you.

Your mindset should always be - i'd rather have my account blocked / miss that package delivery / or whatever,, rather than see my money gone. Be on the safer side.

&#x200B;

I'm starting to think that the source for these leaks of our data comes from within the bank. People working in an official capacity for the bank, either directly, or your typical external consultant trying to sell credit-cards/products who is feeding this info to their scammer friends.

&#x200B;

Not really a question here, just wanted to make you aware of this so that you can avoid the drama, shame and anger afterwards.

1875,submission,nwom8m,2021-06-10 18:12:03,"PSA: More frauds going on at Etisalat scams... Seen a few people mention this, thought it best to share my experience,

There has been some fraudulence going on at everyone's favorite telecom provider for several years now.

**If you've ever noticed or complained about receiving bills for accounts that aren't yours, this is for you!**

*tldr: Etisalat employees (possibly resellers, that's who they blame), are registering accounts using the Emirates ID of customers leaving the country. Account are run for a few months, then left with 000's in unpaid bills where they go to collections, and then onto the credit bureau. Repeat as necessary.*

**longer version:**

I had dozens of accounts (mainly elife and internet, a couple of SIMs), registered under my email address under various names not connected to me. Someone else's Emirates ID, phone number, address, but my email address as the constant between them.

This wasn't a one time thing, it was going on for a year, a couple of accounts at a time, as soon as one went unpaid, other new ones would pop up.

I would get their bills on my monthly statement, receipt emails of payments, etc. These accounts would run for a period of time, then the bills would stop being paid, and after racking up a couple of thousand AED in dues, would get shut and go to collections, who would then start their own cycle of emails. This chain is more or less automated these days.

Etisalat wouldn't help me work out was going on, so I did my own digging. Started calling up the numbers on the accounts, surprise surprise, the people answering the phones weren't the people who's names were on the account. Some of them start getting aggressive with me when I'd question on them on why they were having accounts registered on their number. (I have a lot more about these interactions in particular but I won't reveal it all since I suspect some of the scammers will be reading this, I've seen resellers spamming their ads before getting deleted on this sub).

So I went further, started hunting down the account names on social media, found a few on facebook, twitter, linkedin etc. In every case, the person was an ex resident of the uae.

So what I assume is, someone within etisalat, is passing around emirates id copies of people leaving the country (pretty sure it's an option for 'reason for cancellation'?), at which point their id is recycled and more accounts registered on it. I also assume since I have discovered it,, I am not the only one, and its happening to others : )

You can actually see a complaint of someone that caught onto this: Most of the people having this done using their name, will be clueless about it.

\[[https://www.complaintsboard.com/etisalat-b107538/page/3#c1131079](https://www.complaintsboard.com/etisalat-b107538/page/3#c1131079)\]([https://www.complaintsboard.com/etisalat-b107538/page/3#c1131079](https://www.complaintsboard.com/etisalat-b107538/page/3#c1131079))

Because etisalat refused to help, I tried reaching out. Thought about gulf news, but they would be useless. I tried contacting the police, both regular and cyber police. The captain I spoke with was pretty sympathetic, but I think he realized this slightly more complicated then naughty words on whatsapp or naked girls on a balcony, so he fobbed me off and told me to not worry about it. 'maybe it is mistake?' He actually tried to gaslight me and convince me this was normal, or a mistake. Yeah, 1 account would be mistake, not 15+ : ) If it hadn't been for covid, I would started visiting the addresses on these contracts and knocking on their doors, where there is one shady activity going on, there are often others.

I then filed a complaint with TRA. By this point I had over a year and dozen accounts worth of fake contracts, the numbers being used, my email on them, as well as the aftermath of unpaid dues and emails from collections all in other peoples names. So I showed pretty clearly what was going on. TRA managed to 'sort it' virtually immediately. I got a call from etisalat apologizing. They didn't tell me they were going to see who was doing this, just that **I** wouldn't be bothered with this again, and from that point forward I haven't had another account registered against my email.

I pressed them on who was doing this, and if they were being investigated. They were evasive, claimed it was a 'reseller who had already left'. That's not true. I don't believe them because these accounts were actively being opened and managed right up until they day before I got TRA involved. (I used to 'reset' the accounts using the email, log in on the app, and start changing services usernames/passwords etc, the scammers would catch on, retrieve the accounts and add a PIN. I know this because I would receive chat logs on my email through the app, that's how they were maintaining them). So 'solving it' in this case means, they have solved me complaining about it, because I have caught them and called them out on their scummy practices, that's all. This is probably still widespread and happening.

Compared to the average attempt to scam by morons here , this one is pretty 'genius'. The victim is technically outside the country, in fact, etisalat will argue it's impossible to register an account after the emirates id is expired (if so then how are these being done? I saw the signatured in all the contracts in my email, they all looked like they were done with the same hand), and most people won't go to the lengths I have. And even after that, noone is being reprimanded or investigated, it's all a big house of cards. After all, etisalat is busy posting 'record' year on year increases in profits, subscriber counts, etc. \[[https://gulfbusiness.com/etisalat-group-reports-dhs2-3bn-consolidated-net-profit-for-q1-2021-up-7-9-y-on-y/](https://gulfbusiness.com/etisalat-group-reports-dhs2-3bn-consolidated-net-profit-for-q1-2021-up-7-9-y-on-y/)\]([https://gulfbusiness.com/etisalat-group-reports-dhs2-3bn-consolidated-net-profit-for-q1-2021-up-7-9-y-on-y/](https://gulfbusiness.com/etisalat-group-reports-dhs2-3bn-consolidated-net-profit-for-q1-2021-up-7-9-y-on-y/)) , so why would they listen to one crazy customer calling them out on fraudulent accounts when it's bad for business?

I had to go through a similar process for the collections department, since that's separate, the number of emails from them was getting ridiculous. it was upwards of 40-50 a month given how many accounts there were. Again, the moment I complained and got TRA involved, was the moment it stopped.

For those of you that care, I'm sure some wont, after all, etisalat even says somewhere on one of its emails 'if this account doesnt belong to you, ignore this and dont worry about it' LOL, or something to that effect, cant find what the exact wording is or where it was at this moment. I'm born and raised here, in my experience, just because hamood is saying today 'dont worry this cannot affect you', doesnt mean abdallah in his place tomorrow will be following the same script : )

\[[https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/local/uae-phone-bill-payment-delays-to-affect-residents-credit-score](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/local/uae-phone-bill-payment-delays-to-affect-residents-credit-score)\]([https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/local/uae-phone-bill-payment-delays-to-affect-residents-credit-score](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/local/uae-phone-bill-payment-delays-to-affect-residents-credit-score))

apparently the intention is to eventually link all of these delinquent bills to your access to credit. Even if your name and emirates id are not the ones on the account, if you're receiving the bills, then *something* linking you to them is on there. Iam of the type that would rather not rely on someone elses word that it wont affect me some point in the future.

As for the people whos ID's are being manipulated in this way, well, I can imagine they are in for a potential surprise should they ever return to the uae, as many do. especially if they are completely unawares of whats happening.

Hope this helps someone, if they are being irritated with this problem like I was, maybe there are enough details here to guide you on making it stop. Etisalat are useless, will not, and do not want to help you. Contact TRA with as much documentation as you can produce, and be vigilant.

While the UAE continue to vaccinate a record amount of people - in order to host a successful Expo 2020, you'd need to allow people to actually fly in, meet and mingle. 

More and more voices are pushing to suspend/postpone the Tokyo Olympics to next year. This would be the second postponement. So it will be interesting to see what happens there. Taken into account that the Olympics will only have athletes flying in, there's no need for fans (as more than 85-90% is made by selling rights, and not so much from the fans), I wonder what your opinion is on Expo 2020: should it proceed, could it be too dangerous?

This morning we woke up to a text of her friend informing us that unfortunately her husband has tested positive for covid and she is going to test today. Our first reaction was feeling sorry for her and her husband but then something came to my head: If he just got the results when did he test?  


He tested yesterday because he has been feeling unwell for a couple of days but thought it might be JUST an AC related cold and they are vaccinated anyway. WAIT A SECOND, you are telling me your husband was sick, sick enough for him to be concerned and go testing and still you decided to go out for dinner and put your friend and everyone else you have crossed paths with at risk because you though it was probably a cold and did not want to stay home for ONE day while you get the results????? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? HOW CAN YOU BE SO SELFISH?   


Honestly guys I am sad, very very sad to see people are so irresponsible. I can't even think of how many people have probably died all over the world because someone thought it was probably a cold and did not one to stay home for 24 hours until getting the results. I lost people back home during the first wave and it makes me furious just to think that it could have been a situation like this.  


I feel sad and powerless, I hope there was a way for this kind of actions to be heavily fined. The government is doing a big effort to keep things open and some people are just taking advantage and being disrespectful to all of us.

When it came to DAFZA metro station, alot of people jumped onboard. Didn't knew all of them were going to get down the same place where i wanted to get down. Fast forward to when the bus was stopped in the junction as it was a red light. Left my seat and wanted to stand close to door to get down the bus before the bus leaves. 

So the story starts here. I tried to get way to the exit door as i was at the end. Tried to ask a guy politely to give way but he kept is hand as a barrier and didnt even respond. I got nervous and asked him again and tapping his shoulder incase he didnt understand me. But again no reaction. So i waited untill the bus stop came and he also got down with me.

The problem here is like what's the difficulty in saying, ""i am getting off the same stop""...just a small sentence taking your 10 secs of your life. Probably someone else might have hitted his face with a punch for being such a douchebag.

1. I asked r/Dubai if I should take my current job for Marketing Executive in 2020. It paid 4000 AED and it was all nice and dandy.. ([2020 Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/hwfix8/marketing_executive_should_i_take_the_job/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))
2. Then I faced this horrible accident. To add insult to injury, I was falsely accused of being at fault and unfortunately, I ran out of further money to push the case ahead. I had to pay so much in fines and insurance didn't cover my medical bills. ([Accident thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/mt9q59/wrongfully_accused_in_an_accident_dont_know_what/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))
3. Since the accident, I have been on a debt cycle and I lived anxiously month after month trying to make ends meet. My 4000 AED salary simply couldn't help enough and I started looking for new jobs. I started doing courses and learning skills to develop my portfolio ([Thread about me asking people about SEO here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/nk1fho/feel_trapped_in_my_current_and_job_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
4. By the beginning of June this year, I had applied for 600 jobs and received about 400 rejection emails. I shared this fact so other jobseekers know they are not alone and you have to keep going. ([600 applications thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/nzknnw/600_jobs_applied_400_rejections/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Don't know why this was removed)
5. Today, after 700 applications, I managed to land an amazing job that suits my skills, near my place of residence and in a creative industry! This new job is a 62% pay raise and a lot of my traveling expenses is cut down!

Sure I had to sacrifice a lot of weekends and nights doing courses, refining my CV, applying for jobs and just being miserable with this debt situation. I really thought 2021 is f\*\*\*\*d and I used to go to bed several nights crying skipping meals.

But ultimately, some glimmer of hope. Things can change and will change. Just never lose sight of what you believe you deserve and keeping going. If things could turn around for me, it could for anyone. I am sure of it (maybe a little survivor bias but I suffer from heavy imposter syndrome so idk it cancels out).

I want to thank  everyone who prayed for me and supported me! Yes with this money every bit of it will go through with paying my employees,contractors and rest will go for legal cases 

I want to thank everyone. 

Update: if everyone is interested, I will make a full post on how you can and I was also able to recover my money from those companies who refused to pay

Ive recently started Jogging at the lovely Business bay Water canal area. Its been like 9 months since i have been going there now.  I'm on the heavy side and i kind of struggle with Jogging (I'm cool with brisk walking)

So everyday - with my activity - I've keep passing by  other runners and joggers who say a random Hi or a good Morning etc. I don't know their names or who they are.

Since I've started Jogging - the same random walkers are so encouraging and supportive.

Apart from the usual Good Morning i started getting amazing comments like

""You can do  it""

""Cmon - you are almost there""

""looking good""

you knw the encouraging ones. I cant capture the amazing feeling i get in this post - but its so helpful.

and just to remind you -  these are random people.

So -

To the 5 AM to 7 AM walkers / Runners

THANKS

1. To the Scottish Lady and the guy
2. To the Irani uncle - who is the most  enthusiastic  Morning person.
3. To the Thin and super fast serious Jogger
4. to the Indian Uncle and Aunty :)
5. To the lady with the White Dog.
6. To Kris with his Dog Chloe
7. everyone  - who has said hi or supported my endeavor - thank you
8. The Security guys along the Business Bay water canal

1946,submission,oer5fp,2021-07-06 12:58:59,"A detailed guide for applying for the UAE golden visa for professionals and special talents I have recently got my golden visa. I will write down the steps in details to save you as much visits to immigration:

1- First you visit the Amer center in DFZA. This is the only place processing golden visa in Dubai. Don't waste your time going to Jaafliya, it has moved to DFZA.

2- You ask where is the golden visa office. Mr Ibrahim is the manager and the one handling applications. He is a very pleasant syrian guy. His assistant Mrs Hala is excellent as well but I recommend heading directly to Mr Ibrahim.

3- Mr Ibrahim will check your papers (Will write them down in details later in this post) and determine whether you are eligible or not. While most applicants are doctors, there was a guy there applying for some artists/dancers and they were looking into it, it was not rejected. My observation also is that the 2nd category after doctors was home and business owners.

4- Note that Mr Ibrahim is NOT an immigration officer, he determines your eligibility but he doesn't grant you the approval.

5- Once they determine you are eligible they will ask you to head to Smart Salem to do your medical checkup test. You can pay at Amer or just directly head to any Smart Salem center and walk in to get it done. It costs 760 Dhs. Fun fact: In smart Salem you get served free hot and cold drinks by a robot. The tables have touch screens where you order and the robot will bring you the drinks. There is free valet parking. If you have a spouse you also have to do their medical.

6- You return to Mr Ibrahim again after doing medical. He re-checks your documents and then takes you to an Amer employee to cancel your dependent visas. A very important note is NOT to cancel their visas if they don't have valid medical insurance. Medical insurance is required for golden visa, and once you cancel their visas you cannot get insurance.

7- After cancelling your dependents (Or putting them on hold, your choice) you ask your employer to cancel your visa and labor card (if you have one). Please communicate this with your employer before starting as some employers blatantly refused to cancel their employee's visas (You will have to resign if your employer is not cooperative). Take note you will sign that you received all your dues from your employer when you cancel your labor contract and visa.

8- After your visa is canceled you return your passport to Mr Ibrahim. He will then process it in immigration. He called me the next day to collect my passport stamped. You then head to Amer to apply for dependent visas (Or unhold) and apply for your EIDs.

9- EID arrived in the emirates post office after 3 days.

10- Total cost per person is around 5,000 Dhs. I paid almost 23K for my family.

&#x200B;

Now these are the required documents for doctors. For all other professions/business owners/home owners you will have to get the list from Mr Ibrahim.

* Passport copy.
* Visa copy.
* EID copy.
* DHA License.
* Valid medical insurance.
* Labor contract (Verified copy, you get that from Tasheel for 15 Dhs).
* Ejari contract (Or title deed).

&#x200B;

Finally, everything is different from one case to another and don't let the rejection of others discourage you, go and speak with them and give it a try. You won't pay anything or lose any money since they will first determine your eligibility.

Good luck everyone.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.97,456,125,2021

While the ad is playing press on the yellow ""Ad"" icon, then a menu will pop up, press ""Why this ad"", then you'll get another menu while you're still on the YouTube app. Press ""Report this ad"" and it will redirect you to a webpage where you could choose the reason for reporting it (what policy it is violating), what platform was the ad seen on (Google display/search ads, YouTube, etc.),select YouTube and then it will include a link of the ad in the report that you have made. Just before submitting the report you have a box where you could elaborate more about why you're reporting the ad and why it shouldn't be there. After that press ""submit"" and you will receive an email with your report/complaint summary.

1958,submission,ohdger,2021-07-10 10:23:25,"I passed the RTA final yesterday 🖖🏽 Omg. What a roller coaster of a ride in Dubai. Came here just before the pandemic. No job for 7 months to having a license today and hopefully a car soon! 

Here is my experience with the RTA:


1. Joined the classes almost 2 months back. The first theory test is quite simple and you’ll pass if you know the basics. Since I already had an Indian license, I didn’t have the 40 classes. It was just 10. 

2. I went to a school called Drive Dubai in DIP2. My instructor was a gem of a person. Took his time, told me what exactly I needed to do to pass the tests. 

3. Parking is completely sensor based now. You have to do the whole process alone in a car. 

— up hill 
— emergency breaking 
— Angle parking 
— Garage parking 
— parallel parking 

All in one shot. There is always a simple trick to do all this (mirror points and practice). Ask your instructor for this. Once you do that, the chances of you failing is lesser. Please don’t ever think that you already know parking. I have seen a lot of people who were doing their 7th parking attempt (each one is 280+ Tax). 

I took the single attempt package 3750 AED. 

Once I was done with parking, I had to wait 4 weeks for my final RTA test. This is because of the current COVID situation. Only one person is allowed in the car other than the instructor. 

The final test:

I reached there at 7am (the test was at 7:30). Always reach early as you’ll have time to relax and be alert. 

The instructors came one by one and started calling names. My instructor was super professional, asked my name and my EID, told me to not panic and that if I know driving, it’s a matter of 5 mins. He told me I can start the car whenever I feel comfortable and no need to hurry. We started and he gave basic instructions like take right, take left etc. 

Be confident, don’t go slow. RTA hates it when you go slow. Keep the speed limit. While I was driving the final test, there were 2 trucks on the right lane going really slow. I asked my instructor if I can go around them as it’ll take time. Be confident, don’t drive to pass, drive like you do. Safely and confidently. He said yes and then he told me “you drive well, don’t worry”. That moment was amazing. Total omg moment. We took 2 roundabouts and was back to the school. He said you passed, congratulations. That moment was bigger than my graduation. Went back to the institute and got my printed license in like 20 mins. 

That’s it. 

Some points to note:

1. The examiner is Extremely professional and friendly. They will never fail you if you drive confidently. It’s a myth that they will fail people deliberately. 
2. Dress well. Not like to a black tie event. Just look pleasant enough. 
3. Greet your instructor. 
4. It’s a no brainer that you need to use the indicator when you turn. Always signal before the 75m board before a roundabout. 
5. On the solid white line, count backwards from 1005 to 1000. That’s about 5 secs exactly. You need to stop for 5 seconds regardless of vehicles approaching. 
6. If there is a road joining from left or right, always take a look whether a vehicle is approaching or not. Don’t sit and look straight. 
7. Check your mirror every 40-50 seconds. 

That’s it guys. All the best to everyone taking the exam.",36,"['test', 'driving', 'license', 'road', 'examiner', 'fail', 'instructor', 'failed', 'rta', 'tests']",urban_mobility.driving_license,0.97,294,57,2021

I never had any ""my"" time, at least I felt this way now.

And I made a ""daring"" escape...well, I moved to a new country, and we are no longer talking.

So, now, two of my mantras are ""Just do it"" (I tend to over think things and my inner self critic usually dissuade me from attempting anything.) And pay attention to details, (One of my favourite teacher said that).

So, after I came to Dubai, I am amazed by the welcoming attitude to expats.

Now, to the point:

I have this idea: I had worked in a game studio for a spell, and consider myself an aspiring junior game designer.

The game studio in question had received investment from Tencent,(please, don't bring politics into this one, I do not like epic games either...).

So, its a decent game studio which employed about 200 people. So, you can have a sense of the scale.

I wanted to make a pitch to the Dubai authority, about a series of games that I would like to make to promote Dubai.

;) Just do it, you never know unless you give it a try.

I had sent emails to every department that I felt might be responsible.

I am a total green horn.

And received the most response from DTCM, (mind you, I am grateful for their response, and this is in no way a complaint of the authority, I am just a powerless individual, please don't hurt me).

I wanted to arrange an online meeting with an official, just for 15 minutes to elaborate on my idea.

But, so far, no much luck.

Though I was instructed to check out the Mohammed Bin Rashid Smart MAJLIS website, and I subsequently downloaded the app.

I submitted a request on the 7th of July, no response, but one idea submitted on the 12th of July is turned down.

So, I am just wondering... Had my first proposal been ignored?

Alright, what I am asking is, is there an official channel where an individual might seek funding from the Gov?

Or, maybe I need to polish myself more to make it seems more appealing?

And any recommendations or something that I have been ignorant about?

I know the long holiday is rapidly approaching. So I really want to get this thing moving before that.

I would like to use the official channel as a means to make my idea known and show that at least it is valuable.

I am not going to consider crowdfunding due to several concerns.

I only want to pitch for a small funding from the Gov, I am mostly looking for access to private investors.

So... If I believe in myself and felt like in the book alchemist had said, that the universe is going to make it happen. And beginner's luck.

What else could I have done?

I do not even know where I am going with this post.

(Posted the same thing in r/dubai, got removed)

If you guys want me to post the pictures of what I got, the price, the screenshots of our discussions over WhatsApp, let me know ill post it all below.

**Short version** \- I got a tshirt custom made, and the guy told me if its his fault in terms of printing they will refund, BASICALLY they dint. and the print makes me wanna die.

**Long version** , for all those who stayed-

So my brothers birthday is coming up, and I decided to gift him a custom made tshirt (printed front and back). So I got in touch with this company \[mentioned in the title\]. he seemed extremely unprofessional and just wanted to get done with like my requirements ASAP. I kid you not he was being so stupid both over texts and phone calls, I can't even put it in words. I dint have enough time so I had to unfortunately place an order with them. by the time I wasn't expected anything great ie: I was aware the tshirt will not be of the best quality. BUT I dint think it would be the worse thing I laid my eyes upon. the dude and whoever he got it printed from, printed the tshirt in terrible quality you can see the pixels. furthermore he sent a size chart, from which we picked an accurate size, and the T-shirt came in a WHOLE WRONG SIZE, like my brother can't even wear it since its too broad and long. I called and texted him a bunch of times literally nothing, he's leaving my texts on seen. there was an another company that I had asked regarding the same tshirt, he properly asked me for the exact file type and stuff so the print would be of the best quality, but it was taking him a little longer to get the item made so I dint place the order with them, bad decision.

I posted reviews on their IG page and all but they've blocked me now so I don't really know what to do, to spread awareness. let me know if there's anything I can do.

if anyone needs to see pictures or any screenshots or just anything , type it below. ill do it accordingly.

Being the last day of Eid, it was the mother of crowds in the food court. And on top of that this kid was out of UAE on a visit so she knew her dad's home number which was of no use here. I had an inclination to ask the security guy. He asked me her appearance and he opened his security group chat on whatsapp and her pic was on it. I said yes that's her and they took me to the nearest security kiosk to the food court and she was sitting there. She said an Arab guy found her wandering and took her to the kiosk. He gave her a bottle of water and Eidiya (Eid gift) and left her with the security. Until the idea clicked to ask security the parents and all were roaming around like headless chicken in panic. Always remember to go first to the nearest security personnel as their network is rapid.

Props to the security team of Dubai mall and the random stranger who took her to the kiosk and put her at ease.

I’m a Brit and she’s Ukrainian, and up until now we had our hearts set on Seychelles as it’s a beautiful destination and legally recognized in both the UK and UAE.

However, we want our immediate family to join from the UK/UAE (approx 10 guests).. and currently Seychelles weddings are limited to 2 guests.

Are there any other similar destinations we may have overlooked? Thinking nice scenery, reliable weather, legally recognized etc so that it’s less stressful trying to organise it from the UAE.

2028,submission,p3h5s7,2021-08-13 09:28:47,"Trying to find the right type of place to live in Dubai... Obviously we want to get the best bang for the buck, but we don't mind spending a little more rent for the right place as the rental cost is comparable to medium-tier cities in Canada so we're used to that level of rental expenses.

Initially we were gonna just go for an apartment/condo rental but the concern is the noise-level. Me and my partner are generally not loud people, but it could get maybe a little loud when I'm making out with her. Normally I guess the neighbors would put up with it if it happens once in a while but in a super conservative place like Dubai... that could pose a little bit of risk. It also doesn't help with the fact that we are not officially married. I understand the law was recently amended so that unmarried couple can live together legally but I feel the social norm/culture would still linger and I'd be dealing with number of Dubai cops visiting me. Ideally if the place is relatively soundproof, it'd be fine but I'm assuming walls are thin).

But I donno if getting a separate house/villa is a bit of an overkill especially when there's going to be only 2 of us. We're trying to be reasonable frugal until my business continues to grow to the point where we're not so financially insecure anymore.

Thoughts? Am I overthinking this?

People are asking me about budget so copying/pasting rather than replying to u all.

"" Well, a reasonably decent  condo/apartment go for somewhere between 4600 - 5500 AED ish/month where  I'm from, so I should be decently comfortable with that budget. I've  seen much better budget in many locations in Dubai so this would be  almost max rather than planning to spend this range no matter what per  se.  (I heard DEWA utility can be a bit annoying but hopefully it won't  add too much on top of that). We have no kids so we don't care about  school. Not 100% we are renting a car, but we'll see (if so, being  located logistically at the heart of transportation may not be an  issue).

Impression I get is that  Dubai landlords typically prefer 1 year lease but we're trying to look  for 6 months rental lease or so to avoid the Dubai summer heat season.""

I know the primary issue is my failure at conducting due diligence.

I hired the 3 agencies/companies that lead me to my down fall.

1. T\*\*\*\*\*\* Media
2. C\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 971
3. ZE S\*\*\*\*\*

I hired company 3 for branding while they did a good job with the branding and I was quite happy with the end result, I used the collateral they sent me and got all the packaging and other collateral shipped  to me from China to relaunch my brand under a new more modern identity and look. The branding cost me approximately 40,000 AED, The printing and shipping of all the collateral cost me another 20,000 not including upgrading the interior of my retail stores to match the new branding, Once everything was done, I was quite happy with everything and we launched, 3 months later I received a cease and desist letter from a company in the US, Apparently company 3 slightly tweaked their logo and used the branding which they uploaded on a website called behance.net and just replace the logo with the newly edited one and just replaced their name with mine... Which means I have to completely revamp everything in my retail store and online presence and completely pivot to a new look.

During the 3 months I was using company ""3"" for social media content and management, All the copy and images they used were just a rip-off from the company they original stole the branding from. The only difference was using Arabic and UAE Skyline/backgrounds.

Upon launching the new brand I hired company 2, As they were backed by the UAE government and claimed they were the first Shopify agency in UAE, They even sell courses on drop shipping and ecommerce, They seemed like the most professional agency I could ever work with and their portfolio just confirmed it for me. So I got in bed with them 27,000 + 5,000 was spent with them to give me a custom made Shopify store. Happy as could be we launched our new ecommerce store with their help.

2 Months(Few days after the cease and desist email) later it turns out they gave me one of the free Shopify themes and just changed a few colors around. It took them 1 month to do it... Okay, I feel cheated but business is business, the product works.

Upon launching the website I was happy to employ them for Facebook ads as they did a killer job with the  website imo, So I did, NO SALES IN 2 MONTHS, My 15 year old was running my ads before the rebranding and she got me at least 10 - 15 sales a day.

At same time company 2 connected me with company 1, Company 1 is the leading provider for influencer marketing. I met both the owners and they assured me we would get x4 the sales as we usually would as the the total costs for everything regarding marketing and advertising was 100,000 for 2 months.

I said that would be great, but I won't have sufficient stock. Even if I place an order a week into the marketing and advertising I won't have enough product for the new customers, So I asked them if we could start smaller, They said it would be better to launch big and if the demand is much it will be similar to supreme where there is not enough product to meet demand, I was already going to place an order for product's so I decided to double the total order.

Everything started out great, Tons of influencers posting about it driving up my Instagram followers from 10k to 150k in less than a week. No sales, Tons of traffic on the website, I was happy even if they didn't x4 the sales, simply x2 the sales and I would've been overjoyed, What ended up happening was my customer base got alienated I believe and I was getting no returning or organic customers, I went from on average 500 sales a month to below 50. I asked some of my customers who used to order plenty from me, Apparently they haven't seen a single Ad from my company, They usually get remind by them to pick up a few things every month.

Also all 3 companies have gotten together and decided to ghost me on all platforms.

TLDR: I ended up investing 400,000 with agencies/companies and stocking up my product, Which essentially has to all be changed due cease and desist + I lost my existing clientele due to the marketing companies alienating them and never reaching them through ads. I also have a boatload of stock sitting in a warehouse.

My understanding is that the UAE has a relatively open immigration policy alongside tight citizenship rules, and laws which favor locals over expatriates. Economists report that the GCC by permitting such high levels of immigration does substantially more to reduce global inequality then the ""fortress welfare states"" of Western Europe and North America. Economists also report that benefits from global free immigration would be in the trillions. So the reason there is less immigration is political not economic.

2073,submission,ph4g4b,2021-09-03 16:45:33,"COMPILATION: Various ways to withdraw FIAT money out of a crypto exchange to a local bank account  I have seen many posts about asking the best way to withdraw FIAT (USD/AED) from a crypto exchange to a bank account, so I am going to summarize the exchanges that provide SWIFT bank transfers. This will be beneficial to amounts in 1,000+ AED or else you will lose a lot on fees & you will need to be verified on the exchanges to a bank withdrawal. (options 1-4 are for USD , 5&6 for AED)

Definitions-

Processing Time: ‘Time taken to send the funds after requesting withdrawal’ (on business days)

Credit Time: ‘Time taken to receive the funds after request is processed’ (on business days)

Withdrawal Fee: ‘Fixed Fee taken by exchange to send the funds’

Intermediary Fee: ‘Fee taken by banks in between your bank and exchange bank’

**1.** **Binance:**

Obviously, the best way before was SWIFT USD transfers directly from Binance to your local account, but they halted it a few months ago, however, they are planning to restart it (maybe with a different banking provider, the below is with the silvergate Bank in the US)

**Processing Time:** Several hours (during business hours)

**Credit Time:** Usually Instant

**Withdrawal Fee:** $30

**Intermediary Fee:** $20

There is also P2P from them but I haven’t tried it.

**2.** **Cex.io**

Another trusted exchange I have been using for a long time, however, they are strict so they might ask you a lot of details on the source of funds for trading and withdrawals.

**Processing Time:** 1 Business day

**Credit Time:** Within 24 hours

**Withdrawal Fee:** 0.3% + $ 25.00

**Intermediary Fee:** $20

**3.** **Bitstamp**

Also a straightforward procedure to withdraw USD from, haven’t used them a lot but no complaints as of yet. 

**Processing Time:** Several hours (during business hours)

**Credit Time:** Several hours (during business hours)

**Withdrawal Fee:** $25

**Intermediary Fee:** $20

**4.** **Kraken (Etana Custody) (USD/GBP)**

This is more of a backup exchange I have used for a while, this is a more complex way to withdraw as it requires two companies. Kraken uses Etana Custody to handle their USD withdrawal/ deposits. So you will need to sign up and verify with both companies. First, you have to withdraw from Kraken to Etana (no fees, within a few minutes) and then from Etana to your bank. However, you can also withdraw directly from Kraken in GBP currency.

GBP:

**Processing Time:** 1-2 Working days

**Credit Time:** 2-4 Working Days

**Withdrawal Fee:** 13 GBP

**Intermediary Fee:** $15+ 

USD:

**Processing Time:** 1 Working day

**Credit Time:** Several hours (during business hours)

**Withdrawal Fee:** $35

**Intermediary Fee:** $20

**5.** **BitOasis (AED)**

A lot of love and hate for this platform on this sub, has been reliable for me as of yet however, VERY slow processing times, and once even had to follow up with them after they didn’t process it in their 10-day timeframe.

**Processing Time:** Up to 10 working days (highly variable sometimes faster sometimes slower)

**Credit Time:** 2-4 Working days

**Withdrawal Fee:** 65 AED

**Intermediary Fee:** Nil

**6.** **RAIN (AED)**

This exchange is based out of Bahrain, I have only done a single (so can’t confirm on the reliability of the timings) AED withdrawal from them but I was told they can do USD as well.

**Processing Time:** 1 Working day

**Credit Time:** Several hours (during business hours)

**Withdrawal Fee:** 50 AED

**Intermediary Fee:** Nil

These are all the exchanges I have tried, feel free to add your own experiences and/or suggestions.

I would like to end with getting into crypto is pretty much gambling (when you try to time buys/sells). There is no such thing as fundamentals that you can follow by using charts and indicators. Anyone who tells you otherwise has no idea or is lying or just plain lucky. So don’t think all these people making money from crypto are smart, it's just luck, for every winner, there are many losers holding the bag. At least this is my opinion from someone who has been following crypto since before MTGox failed ( BTC <$500).",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,1.0,17,3,2021

just now, i saw this post on r/dubai through the search bar & it's OP did a miracle in dubai courts.

i dm'd him for guidance few hours ago, but he hasn't replied me yet, so has anyone else here gotten his money through dubai courts with fee postponement?

if yes, where exactly in dubai courts should i go & whom should i speak with?

which documents should i take there with myself?

what do i need to show them to prove i'm going under the sea like aquaman?

How long do they take to get me my money?

thanks.

Edit: i just found out through some papers that i have that the service center i've been to is called al-adheed.  they're not of the government, rather, they're just licensed by it.  just like a fast food franchisee. they asked me for an upfront few percent cut of my money as their fee which turned out to be 40-45k aed. i gave em evidence on how i currently can't afford it & offered them a few percent more cut if they take it after they get my money, & they refused. is there any way i can get my money without hiring any lawyers or giving 4 to 6 figure upfront fee? why is it so hard to get your dues in this country without spending 5 to 6 figure money? it's like you're robbed yet you have to pay the police to get your stolen items back.",1,"['dubai', 'uae', 'arabic', 'people', 'sharjah', 'country', 'abu', 'dhabi', 'emirates', 'like']",uae_cities_region,0.83,16,9,2021

Also a general question as I have never been on an expo like this. What's usually a good way to explore the world expo? Just stroll around and stop when you see something interesting? What are usually highlights of an expo?",5,"['expo', 'beach', 'building', 'khalifa', 'burj', 'mall', 'city', 'marina', 'village', 'tower']",infrastructure.landmarks,0.56,2,5,2021

I got contacted by a local company of decent size here think like 50 employees here in uae and few in US and Europe as they have other branches too.

They wanted a software developer for their new erp and found me a good match for it.

The pay was higher and it seemed like a cool chill company but there is no one doing software development there. I was to be the first guy they ever hired for this job they themselves do not know what it is.

Now upper management doesn't know about my job or what it takes to get it done correctly and my given estimations are always disregarded (lol I am doing sw since 7 years now).. They pull time lines from their arse and get very aggressive to make me do it in it.

I am soon gonna cross probation and I think if I stayed here my mental and physical health with detoriate.

The only think stopping me is even though I think I am fairly good of a sw, there aren't any proper sw companies here or even if they are, they want Harvard bred sw or gcc natives. There is no in between. And rest Asians like me get offered 5 to 6k max. I lol got told in my previous job by my manager when he found out my salary that RTA taxi drivers have it better and that I do that instead. Lol.

So pay is great here. But I will keep on producing sub par level of work here just to keep up with their speed.",3,"['racism', 'english', 'racist', 'indian', 'people', 'country', 'white', 'nationality', 'language', 'india']",diversity_inclusion.race/nationality,0.56,2,8,2021

These are the fraudulent Charges appear as Mobiflix in the statement:

The tech support from etisalat says that I click on some ad on website and enterred the OTP to subscribe to this third party service and consented to the charges, but that is a lie because its not possible on a basic phone with no internet and I didn't get any OTP. This seems a deliberate hack.

Etisalat is basically giving me the runaround. Even when I went to the Etisalat store, the dude at the entrance itself checked and told me rudely to contact 800101 and even after telling him that the call was already made but they said that they can't refund me.

I would like to share a tragic car accident involving my friend on 22nd October in one of the streets in Jumeirah. My friend who just went on her electric scooter to visit a grocery store on her way gets hit by an SUV; she was crossing the zebra cross while the Pedestrian signal was GREEN, and the signal for cars was RED! The driver slammed her across the street breaking her lower back and pelvis bone. The police came immediately for help and my friend was taken via an ambulance. The worst part is the aftermath; the driver who hit her never asked her how is she doing? If she needs any help with the treatment? Neither did the police came for any help except for a few meaningless phone calls. She has been paying her hospital bills and surgery bills (up to 80k AED) up until now merely with the help of her friends. Me and my friends have been trying to get help from the police, we have been trying to get her case reported in the police station. The police tells us that the case can only be filed once the patient has been discharged and we have complete reports of her including the bills. Needless to say this is getting so frustrating and my friend has been in the hospital for 10 days. She has completely lost her mobility, and probably can't work for 6 months to 1 year, her life is currently at halt, and she has no family of her own over here and friends can only do too much to help. 

Has anyone been through a similar incident? Please share your experiences as we are all rookies and the whole ordeal has been really tough on all of us.

A Happy happy Diwali to everyone here an around the world reading this.

Being a follower of the Hindu Dharma(religion) this is one of, if not the most important festival of ours, celebrating this day with our family and freinds is how it has always been back in India and luckily in Dubai too, this city doesnt make me feel like i aint in India.

Been here for 15 years now, something very different happened today, about half n hour back.

Im heading to my office for the prayers and rituals, and just as i get out of my residence walking towards my car, a lil girl, about 10/12 years old, walks up to me, wishes me a happy Diwali and hands me a box of sweets, i wish her back. 

Being unprepared for a random person i couldn't give her anything back.

I start walking to my car, and i notice her go to her mom and dad who were a few feet away, she goes to collect a few more boxes to greet and give them to other people who she sees.

If you have read so far, here comes the main part of this post.

The girl is a Muslim, as i could make out because her mother was wearing an Abaya with a shaila, and the father was wearing a skull cap. (One of the easiet ways to Indentify practicing Muslims) .

My heart is filled with joy, i go to the parents, wish them a Happy Diwali and thank them for the gesture, out of curiosity i ask the mother of the lil girl, as to why they doin this.

""Diwali may be Hindu Festival, but it is an Indian festival too, when i was a yound girl, I always received the blessings and the gifts from my Neighbours and friends, I guess im just continuing the tradition, and my daughter can learn about another faith and spread some joy."" 

To the family of this lil girl, if youre reading this... I want the world to know it is people like you who will make sure love triumphs over hatred. 

A very happy Diwali everyone.. spread some joy, share some happyness.

Stay blessed and stay safe.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.94,412,29,2021

I've heard stories, as I'm sure everybody has, of how you meet people on dating apps and then you realize they have entire families or are in other relationships. It's a ""Dubai phenomenon"".

I've heard of it happening to friends of friends, but I told myself I'd never be that gullible. Cause how do you go so long and not know. Boy was I wrong. 

He was with me for over a year. We talked about a future together. I had my reservations about the relationship but he convinced me that we were going to make it. In hindsight, all the signs were there. He was just so clever, so manipulative, I'm in total disbelief. 

I found out a week ago because his other girlfriend tagged him on a picture. They went to Greece together. He told me he went with his family. He told me his mum and dad were really sick and they wanted to use the time they had to travel the world. But there he was, with his other girlfriend of 12 years, sending me some very tasteful pictures of himself. 

I'm still questioning every thing he said and every moment we shared. I feel like such a fool for being manipulated into this. I still don't understand why. What was the end game. Especially because I was okay with not being exclusive. He demanded exclusivity. All this while he was talking to her about getting married. 

And here's the kicker. When I confronted him, he talked to me like I'm crazy. And for that moment, I believed him. I questioned my own sanity. 

Anyway, since then, I've realised it's a LOT more common than I first expected. To everybody out there, I realize I'm cynical now, but be cautious. Ask questions. Demand answers. Cause I didn't.

I am also planning on working out there, in the education sector. We generally live rather frugally in the UK. I am more inclined to cook from home than eat out regularly. We both aren’t big on shopping for clothes or material goods either. We are good at saving. We do like to go out as a family often though so I anticipate spending in that arena.

Taking into consideration how we live day to day, are we likely to struggle financially in Dubai? I know it’s expensive but it would be good to know if it’s deemed feasible by those of you who live out there, given his salary.

I need a little help. 

I’m a 25 year old male, I have a Bachelor’s degree in Finance, the catch is, its from Africa because that’s where I’m originally from (also I’m white because apparently that matters in Dubai, not caucasian white but Arab white). 

I have opened a few businesses, two of which have hit the 6 figure mark and one hit 7.

&#x200B;

Figured I'd share what happened on the night of 11/11/21. I was heading out to Al Qudra for a ride and took my usual exit to Shk. Mohammed bin Zayed road from Al Asayel st. This was around 8pm. While on top of the massive fly over bridge (previously referred to as ""Death roundabout"") I spotted what looked like a tiny kitten sitting on the side of the road.

Pulled over into the emergency lane and stepped out to take a look. It was indeed a kitten that was probably abandoned. There was no way this tiny ball of fur could make its way to the top of a bridge.

As I approached, the kitten got spooked and ran into the service tunnel.

&#x200B;

[Photo taken after 40 minutes on the bridge. RTA supervisor on site.](https://preview.redd.it/l8ofj1mn0xz71.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=19cebbcd9e84ced9a40ebefc3a3af9d3544439d3)

I called the RTA emergency line and gave all of the details. Didn't know if they would respond or tell me that there is nothing they can do. To my surprise, around 40 minutes later, I get a call from an RTA team of 5 people saying that they are enroute and will try to help me out.

&#x200B;

[We went under the bridge to check if their 15m ladder could reach the tunnel. Unfortunately that wasn't the case.](https://preview.redd.it/xz5bnzl21xz71.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e9dedfb80ea636dd732a1f73a211d757e5465c70)

Their foreman (Naresh) then told me that he has called for an articulated crane and another 2 teams that will be blocking off one lane of the bridge.

&#x200B;

[Massive crane arrives on site. This thing can extend and bend it's arm to reach the underside of the bridge. All while standing on the same bridge. According to Naresh, this is the only crane in Dubai and belongs to RTA.](https://preview.redd.it/nq7iuo5g1xz71.jpg?width=3215&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=80a95c256b3794bada4d4ee19aacbed1cc2a026f)

&#x200B;

[This isn't even it's final form.](https://preview.redd.it/yopzsjlq1xz71.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=74f74120b969535c1bcc3cff697baa9d929a5b35)

&#x200B;

[The guys approached the service tunnel from the side to take a look and to clean out the debris. The tunnel is approximately 30cm x 30cm.](https://preview.redd.it/is7t0oov1xz71.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7390106bdb845fde9e384a4c4bb533318382c8e7)

As the debris was clear, the kitten got spooked and ran to the other side of the bridge. We needed another plan.

&#x200B;

A second crane was then called to approach the other side of the tunnel. With another ""lane blocker"" team to close off one lane of the road.

Since there is no way for a person to fit into that little tunnel, I suggested we make a VERY long stick out of broom handles, attach a plastic bag on the end for cushioning and try to gently push the kitten towards one of the teams in the cranes.

I would like to thank RTA for their time, effort and resources that were spent on rescuing this little thing.

In all honesty, I didn't expect anything to happen when reporting it to them but their response was simply amazing.

I don't have the full names of the guys that were a part of this endeavor but here they are:

\- Naresh

\- Khalid

\- Fazalu

\- Gurpal

\- Harpreet

\- Beeraiah

I couldn't help but think how strict the police are on red light runners for example. The level of risk involved by running a red light is just way too high, almost instilling it in everyone to stop at a light even if no one's around. The punishment makes perfect sense, given just how dangerous of an offence it is, but why isn't the same applied to things like tail gating, sudden lane changes, and lack of giving way at cross walks? Arguably, all of those things are equally as dangerous, potentially causing fatal chain reaction accidents or pedestrian deaths. These things are all supposedly illegal too, but the frequency that it happens at would almost make you believe that you'd be rewarded for driving like an asshat.

Another aspect of the law that I've noticed eliminates offenders in one big swoop is parking fines. There used to be a huge pit behind where I worked where everyone would dump their cars, new or old, short term or long term, and nearly over night, most people vacated when the RTA began issuing fines. Like if it's that easy to get people to follow the law, albeit for something a lot simpler than eradicating bad driving habits, why are certain offences allowed to prevail?

I'm genuinely curious to know what you guys think is stopping law enforcement from being equally as strict on all aspects of law on the road.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.56,4,30,2021

It just so happens that after 6months of interviews, i've been offered a job in a company in Dubai and need your advise on whether i should take it - given the cost of living & everything else that you have 1st hand experience of.

Cash in hand every month - AED 50K. Bonus in hand every 6 months - AED 30K (5K accrued every month and paid as lump sum subject to performance.

Leave : 21 days annual

Beyond this, there is a vague insurance and flight ticket once a year worth AED 2.5K which frankly doesn't even get me home.

I'm a 35yr old UK qualified CA, earning a similar amount in Europe pre tax. The only incremental for me is the tax saving, which is great, but my question to you is -

a) is this enough to live a comfortable life in Dxb ? No kids. Loves a drink (or two) and the occasional splurge on stuff i don't really need.

b) Will i be able to save ? looking to stay in a decent 1BHK or even studio till the wife gets there

c) Is this a good salary for a qualified finance professional at my age or did i get low balled ?

I'm sure the laptop is great, but Amazon screwed me over with this. I needed this urgently for a few events coming up that required a portable yet load capable system (streaming, video editing, rendering...). I was happy this could be availed in 1 day (as I'm a Prime member), and made the purchase. 

Day 1 - I won't lie, Amazon tried delivering it the very next day, but I wasn't available at the hour they came (1900 hours) and so I called and rescheduled it for the next day. 

Day 2 - The next day came, no updates, called them in the evening, they said it wasn't out for delivery and had no idea why and would schedule for the next. No issues. 

Day 3 - I called in the morning, the assured me I'd have it - no updates till afternoon, I called again at 13 in the afternoon, still they assured me if have it. I called them at 5PM, so guy laughed and told me that I won't get it and there's no way he can help, had a bad attitude and didn't help. Made a 4th call immediately after cutting him off, they apologized and assured me that I'd get it within 24 - 48 hours and they'd call me and update me (same line they all said: we'll call and update you). 

Today (Day 4), I decided to call and check in the afternoon and behold the order is cancelled and they are refunding the money.....no reason why it's cancelled, neither call center nor supervisor or logistics cam see what the issue is, they assume it's damaged and hence returned. The kicker, they could have arranged a replacement but didn't (as per the supervisor) and no longer could as the system automatically decided to do a refund - no call to confirm, no information, nothing, it's like the item vanished. It's an expensive item none the less. 

Worst part, I'll have to wait 7 days minimum before the funds hit my account so I can buy a new one. And even more frustrating, Amazon still shows this item as available and can be delivered in one day.....

1. Ordered some clothes online from a popular chain retailer. Been two weeks and I haven't heard a peep from them. Tried calling their only number and no one has been picking up. I called their stores and they said they can't help me as their online store is a separate department. So far, these guys have effectively stolen my money....
2. Tried to order online from a regional sports store but it seems you can't change the billing address to one outside of the UAE. The only other option is cash on delivery. How can a website lack such a basic option?
3. Guy was knocking door-to-door to sell bottled water. He offered me one of those 5 gallon bottles at a discounted rate. Here's how the discussion went:

""Sir, would you like to try one of our discounted water bottles?""  
""Sure. You take card?""  
""Card machine is not working sorry""  
""Ok, I only have a 100 dirham note""  
""Sorry sir, I do not have change""

Need I say anymore??

I do apologise if this comes across as a bit ranty, but my expectations are not sky high. All the aforementioned points I touched on above are very basic and should not be problems in the first place. How hard is it to send an email to your customer telling them their order may be delayed? Adding the option for multiple countries in the address section??? Having a working card reader in 2021?!?

Thanks for all of your great suggestions. Its been very helpful and insightful.. I have few more questions, so thought of writing a new post..

1. What might be actual cost of schooling in Dubai?
2. I can understand there can be difference based on different curriculum..  As Im not aware of the differences, it would be very helpful if you can share some insights about different schools in Dubai, their quality and the fees that I should pay annually..
3. Apart from house rent, what might be additional costs that I will incur in Dubai? It could be regular utilities or even fines, as anything worse can happen at worse times..
4. Is bullying a thing in Dubai schools? Will there be any discrimination within school campus for my kid, for being Indian? Please don't get me wrong as saying Dubai schools are full of bullying or discriminatory.. But, I think this could happen at any part of the world; Im trying to understand to what extend this could be and what can I do to mitigate such things..
5. How easy it would be to get Golden Visa? Do I need help from my employer to do this? Will they be willing to sponsor this? I am wondering because, Golden Visa might decouple me from me depending on my employer, why would they do it?
6. I work in Telecommunication industry, and in Dubai, I will work as an individual contributor (I will report to a VP directly).  How will the work life balance and freedom of work in Dubai? Will I be asked to work extra during my non-office time? The HR said no such thing occurs, but I can't take their word as it is. Will I be respected and will I have my free way of working in the office or the people expect me to be their minions?

This is not about the disrespect a lot show towards this, arguably, 2nd largest industry here. But it’s about masks and the covid mandates. 

Do you think we like having to tell you to wear your mask when you walk in? Do you think, we think, it makes sense that you can remove your mask at the table but not whilst walking around? Do you think we LIKE blocking off tables and chairs so that we keep you distant? 

If you think the answer to any of these questions is yes… Then let me ease your mind. The Muncipality has enforced these rules and more. Under penalty of being fined massively or at worst… Shut down. I have personally had a Muncipality inspector shut a store because a set of chairs were 15cm too close. They let us reopen once we placed more stickers and moved furniture… But we ran the risk of a AED50k fine

We all hate the restrictions. But we respect them. We understand why they are here. 

Oh and for those who say we are rude etc… How would you act if you’re the 30th person on the day to talk to us like shit for just  enforcing the laws of the land… 

So please… Respect us. Respect that we love our jobs and we love helping and serving you. But above all else… Understand we are just doing our jobs.

--------------------------

Salam Alikom friends.

I am planning to visit Dubai on a 3 months tourists Visa.
My goal is to look for a job there instead of trying to post online.

I'm scheduling to travel on the last week of January and the main Area i will be visiting is ""Dubai Internet City"". 
I will write below my plan and hopefully get some help from you guys already living there

* Rent a bedspace in ""Al rigga"" as is appears to be the cheapest and close to metro station.

* The first week is for preparation and getting familiar with the surroundings (where to eat and do laundry for cheap ..etc).

* By February I'll have a plan to start visiting Internet City and try to get myself an interview or at least drop a resume at every possible company.

*Internet City is big and can't be visited in a couple of days. So it'll be a daily trip from morning to work hours end.

This is all i got at the moment . I hope you can elaborate or help me.
What would you do differently if it was your plan.

Also am i wrong not renting near the city i will be visiting all days ?

I hope this post get noticed",1,"['dubai', 'uae', 'arabic', 'people', 'sharjah', 'country', 'abu', 'dhabi', 'emirates', 'like']",uae_cities_region,0.86,12,12,2021

[Husband]: my wife has back injury

Security guard then calmly unlocks and hands over the trolley without saying an extra word.

In comes the entitled brat son, in his late 30s I would say, he was not even there when the conversation took place and told the security ""Mate, you don't have the right to object"", the poor security guard tried to explain but the son continued ""Zip it, you are not allowed to object""

2308,submission,rum5nv,2022-01-03 03:07:26,"Little disillusioned with Dubai, help me recapture that flame? Hey guys so I grew up in Dubai back before the malls, when Burj Al Arab was fairly new and onwards. I went abroad when the oil price drop happened and economic decline of the Emirates and came back recently. Mind you I liked it here before, and I loved the distinct Dubai feel. However now it seems like there is a lot of copy paste from everywhere else without any real uniqueness of what is Dubai. Additionally a lot has changed, esp with most of the large investors and capitalists no longer being in the city, and a lot of business having moved.

I do however see this new startup sort of scene and an attempt to rebrand itself, which I see being choked by labor laws and high startup expenses relative to a lot of places as well as RIDICULOUS high cost of living (I mean McDonald's charging 2AED for ice cream was the straw that broke the camels back, hehe). But jokes aside, I am curious, what incentive makes the current residents move in/stay?

The salaries aren't equal or greater than places that have taxes, even after tax has been accounted for. The tech scene is still far behind. I see a lot of globally competitive cities in a far better position with only increasing competition. And yet, for example I see the real estate market, one of Dubai's key indicators, rebounding in some areas. My worry still is in a relatively uncompetitive labor market in some critical industries compared to abroad. Not to mention I would get people retiring here, but in terms of kids growing up and trying to start a career, there is very much a distinction that still exists of whether you're a resident or local, and if a resident, what nationality of resident, which are more accentuated than some other places.

Now I'm very sure I'm missing something here that are in favor of Dubai, and that's probably from being away, so catch me up, what makes people stay/move in? And how do you see the trend progressing, and based on what markers?",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.48,1,24,2022

I'm in Dubai at the moment for a holiday as well as a recon trip for job/work opportunities. 

I noticed that during the fireworks, the Burj Khalifa had English, ARabic and Chinese New Year's greetings displayed. Does anyone know why? I am guessing it's a political thing and the government here wants more economic relationship with China?

I speak a few languages, two of them being Mandarin and Russian and I've worked as a relationship manager between the west and China. I've brought Chinese business to clients, procured goods/services from China for clients in the west, and assisted CHinese clients with investment etc. I have a large network in Asia, especially China.

I'm originally from Australia and wonder if this experience is useful in the UAE?

I recieved the photo of my food in my doorstep but when i opened the door its not there.  
I just moved in to this building, i started to think that one of my neighboors took my food.

I called deliveroo again, i was furious.

I notice most of the good companies in Dubai are looking for the candidate who is/are good looking despite of the applicant knowing everything about the role. I guess talent doesnt beat appearance. Like some recruitment guys that called me dont even know how to properly screen the candidates profile. And some HR manager have already assumed that all applicants were terminated from their previous job. But refuse to believe that there are still people (like me) who resigned the job from a very famous and big company in the UAE without any job offer in hand. Yes I did that. I took the risk. If the career growth is limited then why do u have to stay even how good the company is, if its not serving you purpose then u have to find it and move. 

And thats what i did.
But recruiters are mainly focused on getting a candidate that appears to be good looking, wears make up and all that stuff. Skills amd experiences are just secondary. Its like a good face or a good set of teeth equates to being trustworthy and can-do-everything in a corporate world. Sadly to say.

Now for my job I'm barely in office so I try to get quick refills while I'm at work to save time but no matter what time of the day I order fuel, there's always a 3h offset on this app that's supposed to make fuel refills more ""accessible"". In those 3h I can walk to a nearby station, get a tank filled, walk back and fill my car tank myself in the worst case scenario. What's even the point of this service if not for emergencies? What's even worse is that there was an option to top up your wallet for emergency but there's no option to withdraw this amount. When I contacted their live chat they're saying it's non refundable?! So after  using their service just once I have 100 bucks stuck on this app for no use because this 3h offset is never gonna let me use this service.

Edit: Advance booking really isn't an option. Today morning for example I was reaching my office by 9. The earliest slot was 12-1. By 10-10:30 I had to leave office and wasn't back till 12:30. Which means I could have missed my booked slot. This has been the case almost always.

I'm sorry but you don't get to criticise a restaurant's quality on the same level as someone who has actually taken the effort to go to it to try it. There is a reason why high end places avoid delivery (barring COVID lockdown situations) and that is because the quality of the food is both out of your control once it leaves your hand and one does not know how the delivery driver is handling it since they are a totally different system optimised for getting your food delivered at the shortest turn around time.

Instead of expecting hot food delivered perfectly, get out there and try it before knocking on it.",7,"['talabat', 'delivery', 'price', 'zomato', 'deliveroo', 'order', 'restaurants', 'restaurant', 'customer', 'business']",dining_services.restaurants/delivery_services,0.63,32,56,2022

Since then I contacted the Landlord’s office and they got back to me to say they sent notice of a 5% increase to my email on 7th January. The email address they sent it to was spelt wrong, therefore I did not receive the notification. What to do now? Legally, they have not notified me, right?

2393,submission,sv5buz,2022-02-18 05:33:36,"Unexpected turn of events So I’m just chilling in a cafe inside Sharjah airport. It’s almost empty since it’s around 5:00am, 16°C waiting to catch my flight and I hear the cafe cashier going to a lady sitting far behind me. He started asking her for cash as he’s not allowed to give food without paying but he did and now she’s not paying due to some reason. She barely speaks any English and was just saying “I no pay”. The cafe guy got really pissed off (naturally) and was telling one of the security guys that she might have some mental issues as she left her ticket and passport at the counter when she came in. The guy kept getting louder and was borderline rude. He called the airport police and he came in with a lady officer as well. They asked what’s the issue and the cafe guy said she’s refusing to pay (around 25 AED). The police officer questioned her in a very polite manner and checked her passport and ticket and quickly came to a realisation that she doesn’t have the money to pay. He gave back the passport and went to the billing to pay from his card. 

I mean I have never interacted with an Emirati policeman but this guy was a gem. Thank you all front line service people, wherever you are. It was a really kind gesture. 

She just left. 
Happy ending.

Yet this guy kept going in circles around the area we were sitting and WOULD NOT TAKE HIS EYES off of us! Like it was dark asln u couldn't even see anything. We tried a couple of things. 

1- Stared back to let him know we noticed so he'd feel ashamed ? (Little did we know) 2- after around half an hour I yelled at him 3- my friends yelled at him 4- we threatened to call the police. He still wouldn't leave. And one of our friends was like ""that's exactly what they want, they just want women to react to them"". And the yelling didn't work, and there isn't much that a security can do.


So what exactly are we supposed to do? We can't even enjoy the little things. And it happens on a daily basis.

Peru. Mesmerizing from the moment you step in the access bridge (especially it at night), and into the amazing three worlds of Peru.
Runner up: Benin. Tasteful and well thought journey, focused messaging showing ancient artifacts with their associated legends and stories.
 
2. The Design Award
UAE. Because of course, look at it, it must win. Plus the pavilion has wings, wings that flap, twice every day.
Runner up: Uzbekistan. Fantastic design and attention to detail, inside and out.
 
3. Best Concept Award
Syria. Thousands of Syrians poured their hearts into the pavilion, and it shows.
Runner up: Estonia. The closest manifestation to the metaverse (or a different take on the matrix).  
 
4. Disappointment Award
UK: Lorem Ipsum is still Lorem Ipsum even if they say it isn’t. Let’s just not pretend otherwise.  
Runner up: Bahrain. A small country sometimes needs a big empty box.
 
5. Most creative Award:
Singapore. It is a building? Is it a tree? Is something in-between? Maybe a tropical building-tree.  
Runner up: Pakistan: Two buildings presenting past and future in a connected journey. Hits you in the feels.
 
6. Tries-so-hard Award
Germany: You cannot not learn that stuff. Nien, you better learn this stuff, otherwise you don’t graduate.
Runner up: USA. Standing on a conveyor belt and forced to listen to propaganda felt un-American.  
 
7. The simpleton Award
Austria: Feel, see, hear, smell, and touch the mud, with a couple of gimmicks. Simple but it works.
Runner up: Turkmenistan. We have horses, and empty spaces. That’s it. That’s the Pavilion.     
 
8. “You’re doing Expo wrong, Bud” Award
Croatia: They forgot the exhibit and used the space as a parking lot.
Runner up: Greece. Shows you what their exhibit was supposed to be. Blame austerity.
 
9. People pleaser Award
Thailand. Tik and Tak (Pip and Pap, or whatever their names were) made me feel young again. Let’s go on a journey!
Runner up: Cambodia. Step into Angkor wat and find treasure, Indiana Jones style.

DP World. Because hyperloop. This is the plan, this is Dubai. DP is doing it. Not enough? Cargo hyperloop!

I am going borderline insane trying to find an internship related to data science or data analytics. I'm not even getting replies from job listings (god damn internships for second year college students!!!) which ask for qualifications far below what I have. 

I'm including simplified details to not give away too much information.

**My Education:**

*Note: I'm in my last semester so I don't have the degree yet.*

- Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from a local university. It's accredited nationally and internationally. 

**Experience:**

- Job 1 (Engineering Consulting Intern) : Run of the mill electrical engineering, some programming, and helping the marketing team understand engineering concepts. 
- Job 2 (ML + Computer vision, research): Wrote a research paper on a computer vision + machine learning technique.  
- Job 3 (IoT solutions intern) - Programmed an application in python, used rest apis, mqtt protocol, built dashboards, did some front end work with basic html/css.
 

 
**My skills** 

- Python (Pandas,NumPy, Keras, Sklearn), and general programming using the standard libraries. 
- SQL (MySQL)
- Machine Learning (Published a paper and am going to publish 2 more soon) 

**Accomplishments:**

- Won 2nd place in an international business analytics competition. With 0 BA skills, just did basic statistical inference and forecasting that made sense to me.

I also have 2 flagship projects in my CV and linkedin that shows various data analytics/science related skills such as web scraping, data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, model testing, model building, deep learning, etc. 

I am not claiming to be the most skilled person in the world, far from it, But I am not even getting callbacks from jobs that lists only microsoft excel competency! If I am competent enough write and publish a research paper on deep learning, I should be smart enough to be trusted with microsoft excel right??

2430,submission,tce5mm,2022-03-12 15:04:02,"Unknown accident and the plight with Dubai Police So this incident happened with me yesterday, and I would just want to know whether this is an experience anyone else has had with Dubai Police's system during a car accident with no injuries, or if it was just a bad day for me. Also, any suggestions are welcome as well. Especially if there is any way to rate the service of Dubai Police. It's going to be a longish read.

&#x200B;

**The incident:** I had parked my car on Al Ebdaa street which is a parallel street/service road to SZR going towards Abu Dhabi. The place I parked was just about 100-150 meters further from the Emirates Tower Metro Station. I park at a regular parking spot at about 2.30pm to have lunch at a nearby restaurant. I come back to my car around 3.45pm only to notice that the rear right side of my car is badly damaged. Here's the picture of my car:   [https://imgur.com/LKO02MQ](https://imgur.com/LKO02MQ) . I ask around and someone says that about 15-20 mins ago, a white car driven by a lady hit my car and there was commotion and traffic for about 5-7 minutes, and then she drove away. The damage on my car was too much so I decided not to drive or even move it till I know what to do.

&#x200B;

**Trying to investigate:** I call Emergency 999 and explain the situation. They asked if there is any camera around. I said there are a few restaurants and one building camera (Building Name: Sahara Tower) that I can see. So I speak to building security who makes me ask permission from the landlord so that they can show me the CCTV footage. Much to my bad luck, the car can be seen hitting my car; its a white SUV/crossover, not sure which model, but the number plate is not clear. :/ I ask if there is any other camera, to which he says no. I go ask Starbucks which is in the same building and also facing the road where my car is parked. They said they can't access the CCTV cameras, need to ask corporate and is a complicated process, basically telling me nothing can be done.

&#x200B;

I come back to my car dejected, and call my insurance to explain what happened, and also arrange recovery. Insurance arranges the same, but also tells me to get the police report before loading the car on the recovery and taking it to their approved workshop. So I call 999 again and explained the entire thing. They keep saying they cannot send a Police Patrol, so I need to go on the Dubai Police App or Website and get my report under 'Unknown Accident'. For this I also need to pay **AED 420/-**.

I have no other choice so I do that. Again, maybe because of my bad luck the app does not work properly, so I go on the website. I add all my details including the pictures of my car, and at the end it gives me an error saying 'This service is unavailable'. I try it almost 3 times but it keeps giving the same error. I then try to switch from Google Chrome, to Samsung's Browser, then take my old iphone to do the same on Safari browser. Nothing, same error.

&#x200B;

**The nonsense:** Then I get a call from a random landline number who tells me they are Dubai Police and they see me uploading the pictures of my car. They say the damage is too big to report it as 'Unknown Accident' so I should call 999 and ask them to send a Police Patrol to investigate and open a 'Hit & Run' case. So I called 999, they keep saying report it as 'Unknown Accident', we cannot send Police Patrol. So I called the landline number back, that lady then transfers to her senior who asks me to convince the people at 999 to send a Police Patrol. I call again, but same response from 999. So I called the landline number again, and this Senior guy asks me my location, and then tells me to go to the nearest Police station which is Bur Dubai Police Station near Jafiliyah Metro. By then the recovery guy comes, I somehow convince him to load the car without the Police Report after explaining the events to him. He agrees and we both go to Bur Dubai Police Station.

At the Police Station, I was a headless chicken going from one desk to another because nobody seemed to care too much. Ended up with this old guy who basically handles accidents and accident disputes. I explain the situation to him, he ends up saying the same thing; report on Dubai Police App/Website as 'Unknown Accident'. I explain to him that its giving me an error, and Dubai Police themselves called to say the damage on the car is too much and I should open a hit and run case at the Police Station. He said you can do that online. I ask him where the hit and run option is online because I cannot find it. He's like maybe it will come tomorrow, or the 'Unknown Accident' error will go tomorrow, so try tomorrow morning. I told him that I cannot leave the car at the workshop because they won't accept my car without the Police Report. He then says call 999 and make me speak to them. I called, explained again, then gave him the phone. They speak something in Arabic which I don't understand since I don't speak the language. He then gives me the phone, and the 999 guy says I know your case now. Go back to the accident site with the car and call 999 again and ask for me. I will arrange for a Police Patrol to come. I'm like, okay maybe I shouldn't have moved the car, but they are not blaming me for it, so I sit in the recovery and go back to the accident site. While going there, the recovery company calls me to inform that these further trips will cost me, it won't be complimentary. I had no mental strength at this point, and I needed the recovery, so I just agreed.

I get to the accident site, call 999, ask for the guy, and he takes the address for the location and says the Police Patrol should get there in 10 minutes. I receive a call from the Police Patrol in 15 mins asking what happened. Again, with all the strength I had, I explained to him. He's like is there a camera around? I say yes, the car who committed the accident can be seen but not the number plate. I tell him there are other cameras on the road ahead and for sure at least some camera must have caught the number plate. He says okay I will come, send me your location on Whatsapp. I'm thinking I already gave the previous guy my location and explained exactly where I am. But whatever, I send the location to the Police Patrol on Whatsapp. He arrives after 20 mins, inspects the car and the location, asks some questions. That's it. He doesn't even go to the Building Security of Sahara Tower to check the CCTV footage. He takes my ID, license, car registration, and asks me to come to Bur Dubai Police station. AGAIN!!!

By then, I'm apologizing the recovery guy and convince him to take me and the car to Bur Dubai Police Station. I also tip him for his troubles. We get there, and this Police Patrol guy says I have spoken to the concerned people. He hands me my license, ID, and Car Registration, and asks me to try now to do the 'Unknown Accident' on Dubai Police website. I said, you cannot register a hit and run case? Why should I pay AED 420/- for someone else's fault? He says these things keep happening, so just count my loss and move on. I said okay, and come out to try my luck on Dubai Police website. Again, same error! I almost felt like my head was going to burst. So I called the Police Patrol guy again (I had his mobile number because I sent him the location on Whatsapp), and he says okay no problem, go to this particular guy inside Bur Dubai Police Station and tell him I sent you. I said okay, and head to this guy. Turns out, he's the same old guy I met previously who didn't help me. I tell him this Police Patrol guy sent me to you, he's like okay yes but what do you want? I explain again, and he tells me try tomorrow morning. I say no, I need to Police Report now. Then with a loud voice he tells me call 999 and ask them how to upload details for Unknown Accident. I tell him that I know the process, but its giving me an error, that's the problem. So he sends me to the Receptionist guy who is a local and is clearly not interested to work on a Friday evening. So I just walk out and think of keeping the car somewhere and trying tomorrow before I send the car to the workshop. While I was walking out, I get a call from a landline number who says they are Dubai Police, and why I have been uploading my details multiple times on the Unknow Accident portal. I tell them its because I keep getting an error. He says okay, you will receive an SMS with the payment link. Pay AED 420/- and you will receive the Police Report via email. I received the link, paid, and got the Police Report! Success! I then took the car to the workshop and dropped it around 9pm.

The above incident, from the time I got to know my car was damaged, till I received the Police Report was 4 hours!!! It took me 4 hours to go through this hassle, only for Dubai Police to call me and send me a payment link to send me the report to give the insurance.

I only want to highlight a few things:

* It was clearly possible for 999 to send a Police Patrol, but they kept denying the service.
* The police could've easily investigated, but they chose not to, even after some people from their department suggested that it would be better not to report this incident as an Unknown Accident due to the extent of the damage on my car.
* This running around was exhausting for me mentally as well as physically. What if it was a Senior Citizen, or a woman in this scenario? I hope this doesn't happen to the worst of my enemies.

Basically, uncertainty over some incidents can be easily controlled by the Police. But they failed to do so. I would want to know if there is any way I can review this particular department. I know Dubai is a world class city, and I love the UAE, and also consider a long time resident of this place. But such inefficiency over something this simple is simply not right.

&#x200B;

Tl;Dr: Unknown accident on my car resulting a very bad damage.

My dad was celebrating his 50th birthday a couple of days ago and I decided to take him and our family out for a nice dinner. I reserve a table at Texas De Brazil in Dubai Mall under my name and mobile number.

Now, I am an Indian Christian and I have an Irish name. I also have a slight British accent due to my schooling here. This provides context for what's going to happen.

So I reach Texas De Brazil and ask the maitre de for my table. I tell them my name and number and the reservation time of 8pm. He looks a little puzzled and asks me my name again and I say it again. He asks me to go away and not bother him. Surprised and a little insulted, I ask him what he means and tell him again that I'm jon\_show and that I have a reservation for 8pm. He tells me that they have already seated a person with my name and that I should stop playing games. I start getting a little annoyed and tell him that no, I am here for my reservation and that I have not been seated before. He replies by stating that I do not look like my name and that I need to show him my passport to prove it. I am proper angry by now and ask him what he means by this statement. Still unbothered, he asks me again for my passport.

I show him my Emirates ID with my name and share the number that's assigned to my reservation, finally asking to be served by someone else. He sees my name and number, checks with the system and suddenly starts giving a shit and starts apologizing. I ask him what he meant by all this and he replies that he had already let someone with my name in before and that he thought I was messing with him. I asked him what he meant by his ""I do not look like my name"" statement and asked him why he did not check the other person's phone number to cross reference the reservation. He repeats his sorry for a few mins more but doesn't give me an answer.

But it is excellent that there is a realization that we actually weren't attracting the best talent and creating economic value to the city's real potential.

An economy built on the backbone of good old trading businesses that created low-value outputs attracted very operational human resources realized that they've made one of the best infrastructures in the world that are massively under-utilized from an economic value POV.  We were a protective economy that rewarded pretty average talent and output, 10X more than it deserved.

In any advanced economy, value creation plays a significant role. You need entrepreneurs who create enterprises, take them public, and create wealth for the economy. In contrast, we ended up having businesses that were too profit-centric and continued the path of less than 10% growth annually. Mammoth companies are built when you own the IP and create value. They also attract a lot of intelligent people. These bright and intelligent people take the game to a different plateau.

It is also excellent of them, to realize that what worked in the past for this place may not work going forward.   If there is one place that used the uncertainty of the COVID-19 outbreak to its advantage, it ought to be UAE and, most importantly, Dubai.  I am guessing many smart people visited and moved to Dubai to continue remotely working from here.  This has opened up many opportunities we otherwise would have explored a little later.

The same guys, who asked me ""why the f are you stuck there?"" a few years back, ask me ""How to move there?"". Not sure if all of us are realizing the positive changes around us. But it is happening guys.

When change happens, there can be a lot of plain opportunists who would jump into cash-in. That is a normal thing. But if we need to learn some lessons from the past, all of them who tried their hands at things they didn't have a clue about, went irrelevant. I am talking about the new NFT and Metaverse gang. They'll go irrelevant soon.

The number of solid bright folks landing up here in product management, tech, growth, etc is huge.    When that happens, roles get redefined. Good people learn the new game faster. Loads of jobs get created and that is a piece of awesome news for kids who studied here and are doing sales jobs without salary as interns. They are likely to have real opportunities to have real jobs and be part of building enterprise value for their new employers.

Anyways please know that official authorities like the police or your bank would always use your phone number and email to contact you, NOT WHATSAPP

2509,submission,ufamnz,2022-04-30 17:01:29,"A story of a Dubai Business Owner  

Hello everyone… I just thought I’d share a quick story about a very honest, humble yet innocent business owner who got the raw end of the stick in one of his deals…

And the reason I want to talk about this is that I see this happening SO much in the UAE… I see so many honest, hardworking business owners get really into trouble and in the process, they lose so much money, so much time AND also their mental health..

In my 17+ years of legal consulting, I’ve seen that UAE law can be rather tricky to understand…

ESPECIALLY for new and up and coming business owners… and this becomes a HUGE problem when you start doing really well..

You’d be surprised HOW some small unintentional oversight lead to huge stress and losses and loss of potential future opportunities.

So just to give you a quick glimpse into the plight of one such business owner of a restaurant that wanted to sell his business… Here's a few things that will actually PREVENT you from having the miserable fate that he had!

Long story short – this business owner sold his restaurant to a new owner… and the banks came chasing the old owner for pending loans!

Now - the seller made a few mistakes here..

BUT those few mistakes - cost him his peace of mind, money, lost time, and mental health for 15 MONTHS!

Instead of being able to move on to the next venture that he had planned (with the money he made from his sale)... he was STUCK for MONTHS, trying to fight the court case.…

At the end, we won the case for him… BUT nothing can replace the lost time, energy, mental health…

Now here’s why I am telling you this…

I want to PREVENT you from making these mistakes that will save you …

**Mistake 1** \- NOT HAVING THOUGHT THROUGH YOUR CONTRACTS:

The client has sold his business to the new owner without properly thinking through the implications of the bank loans. He just thought that the loan will be transferred to the new owner together with the business.

**Mistake 2** \- NOT HAVING PROPER LEGAL TERMS/LANGUAGE

The contract was drawn without taking any support from the expert. This resulted in terms of the contract being capable of being interpreted in more than one way.

**Mistake 3** \- TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING YOURSELF / TRUSTING PEOPLE TOO MUCH

He thought that he and the new owner enjoy trust and friendship and therefore the contract is just a formality. So he just drew the contract ON HIS OWN without benefitting from the qualified legal advice.

**Consequences**

The bank came chasing after the client for the outstanding loans as the new owner failed to make any payment.

The client in the meanwhile has shifted to UK and therefore a statutory demand to pay was presented to him.

The failure to pay pursuant to the statutory demand or objecting to it and setting it aside would result in the court starting bankruptcy proceedings against client.

If the bankruptcy proceeding started the client will potentially lose all of his assets and there are also implications for him with respect of doing business going forward.

The client objected to the statutory demand and we were retained to provide expert report on UAE Laws for certain clauses of UAE Commercial Code.

Our expert report was accepted by the UK court thereby setting aside the statutory demand and relieving the client.

However, all of these cost the client so much in terms of time, energy, resources and money.

This could have been easily avoided IF and only IF the client has taken proper legal advice initially.

He could have discussed end-to-end transaction details with his lawyer

Set proper contractual terms taking into consideration the outstanding loans

That would have only cost him a fraction of the costs he incurred now and have ALSO saved him time, and resources AND he could have easily pursued his other business opportunities without any distraction.

If you know any student that has been asked to remove their abaya or hijab to sit for an exam. You may want to give the podcast a listen (Shared the source below)

TLDR: The radio listener asked a question regarding the legality of a school in the UAE not allowing a student to sit for an exam if they're wearing the abaya. Listen to the podcast in the link for the legal advice that was given. I've summarized it to the best of my ability below.

The legal advice given was to continue wearing the abaya and go to the exam premise. In case the school does interfere with the student's attire on the day of the exam. The police can be involved. This also may fall under religious discrimination and/or invasion of privacy.

Hope this helps.

Was commenting on another post and remembered this incident, thought I'd share to see if anyone else faced anything similar.

This was years ago, I was 19 and was waiting at the metro station. I use the female cabin 99% of the time, and this time was no different. Tourists usually have no idea that it's a female cabin, and not wanting them to get fined, I politely let them know and help them get to another cabin. They're grateful and proceed to ask for directions and it's always a pleasant conversation as I enjoy helping people.

One day I see this (I think British, not sure but definitely European) white guy in his 50s waiting at the ladies' cabin. His outfit looked very touristy too, so I politely let him know ""Hi! Just letting you know you're waiting at the ladies cabin, you could get a 300 dirhams fi-"" he gets real close to my face, cuts me off and half-whispers ""I know where the f\*ck I'm waiting you bloody Indian"" and that caught me off-guard. He proceeds to start saying worse things, telling me I don't deserve to exist, that I belong in the kitchen, and that the UAE will always prefer white dudes like him over ""scums"" like me.

Usually, I freeze and just stop functioning, but he started inching closer as if he was going to get physical. In fear, I started backing off and quickly pulled out my phone and dialled 999 to show him and told him I'm going to call the police, to which he responds again ""as if they'll believe a bloody Indian like you over me!"" I had enough that a guy almost thrice my age was acting like this just because I wanted to save him from a fine so I started yelling back ""I'm going to call the police!"" (embarrassing, I thought of better comebacks only 2 days later xD). A crowd starts forming, clearly watching a guy thrice my age verbally abuse me and no one stepped in to help, I think this was what hurt me the most.

Then this old dude's son (probably in his mid or late 20s) comes and drags him away telling him ""leave that b\*tch she may actually call the police"" and they went to the other end of the train. I was shaking, close to tears, and everyone was just staring at me. Again, no help.

I reach my station and go to the RTA helpers, and told them what happened. I told them I knew the time and the exact CCTV cameras that were there, to which they said ""This is not our responsibility. Go to the police officer there"" and I did. I go to him, explain what happened, and he just shrugged and told me to call 901 next time. The lack of support and help made me feel extremely dejected, disturbed, and to this day I still have no idea what to do if it ever happens again.

So I was curious - if you've faced anything similar (firstly, I'm sorry you experienced it), have you reported it? Was any action taken? How did it go and what were the consequences faced by the offender?",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.93,407,294,2022

But on 6th month wife's water broke unexpectedly and we had to rush her to the hospital.

I drove her to 3 different hospital,  all the hospitals said they didn't have the right equipment to keep the baby once he is born.

We were sent to Sheikh Khalifa Hospital as a last resort.

Wife was quickly admitted , I was waiting out side as due to full blown COVID at that moment no one was allowed in to the hospital. 

After 2 days we were blessed with a baby boy who needed to be sent away to NICU (Neonatal intensive care unit) Immediately.


This hospital was a pet projet of Sheikh Khalifa and he made sure it had the best equipment to save the life of extreme pre-mature babies. 

5 long months of hospitalizations and  my boy was saved !!! 

I have never met the man who made it all possible , but today hearing about his death gave me a chill
down my spine. I felt lost and just stared at my baby reliving those hospital moments.


Now every time I hold my baby , I realize how lucky we were to have Sheikh Khalifa as a leader.

Hey guys so I recently moved to Dubai four - five months ago and managed to get a job in the first three months, but I don’t want to just have one source of income so I was looking at options and seems like real estate has a very good market for people to invest their time and money and get a certain amount every month/year. 
But then you cannot buy a whole flat/villa and then rent it out, like it’s not possible until  &unless your dad or mom or you have inherited millions of dollars, But then I figured out that these guys that rent out bad spaces/partitions don’t own the place they rent from somebody else who is already the owner and make partitions/bed spaces and then further rent it down to people. 
Which does not look like a bad business model for somebody who is young and does not have any money in the pocket, my only question is, is there any criteria of age or nationality or income which will help you get such people to rent out places to you and you can further do all these things such as making partitions in the houses are making bed spaces and renting out to people?

I hope the title is pretty self explanatory. 

A little background about me: I'm only 20 years old, got a job through connections a year ago, I work in the private sector.

Lately I've realized I've been getting angry at the simplest of things at work and I want to lash out or start yelling at people. This continues when I go home. I know this isn't normal but I can't help it. My work environment is very hostile, stressful and everyone is just yelling at each other to get shit done. My CEO is also the same, if she wants to get a job done she just yells.

I also forgot to mention I have to endure this pain for 6 days a week from 9:30AM till 6:30PM. We barely have holidays. Our Eid holidays were ruined since we worked on 30th of April (Saturday) and resumed on 4th of May (Wednesday) when all of UAE was off until the 9th. I get very envious of my friends who tell me they only work 8am till 3Pm AND they have a full weekends starting from mid-friday to Sunday, while I work Fridays full day AND Saturdays.

When His Highness Sheikh Khalifa passed away (may his soul rest in peace) and the public grieving holiday was announced, the CEO told us that we would be working Saturday and Monday, and we won't have the holiday. That pissed of alot of employees.


Now I know some of you are gonna tell me to ""suck it up"" or ""some people are jobless, be grateful"" but I don't even earn that much and I've already contemplated suicide several times. I just can't handle it anymore and I've been looking for better jobs for months now. I feel like my mental health has gotten really unstable as I literally can't stop myself from hurting myself at work BECAUSE of my work. I also can't quit because I'm the only one earning money in the family.

I never understood why some company owners act like that. I'm pretty sure it never gets the job done. Having overworked employees with little salaries won't do much for your company. Later on she complains that no employee wants to stay in her company and she doesn't know why, and there's alot of work pending because they keep having to train new employees.


Anyway if you've read this far then I really appreciate it. I would like some guidance.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.92,10,5,2022

Anyway, Karen steps out of the lift and goes to talk to the reception. Karen’s daughter runs off and out of the building.  I’m about to tell Karen that her daughter is out of the building when I see Karen’s daughter rushing to the road where cars are going super fast.

The security guard on duty jumps out, grabs Karen’s daughter and pulls her back from the road and then brings her back to the building. I witnessed the whole thing.

Karen comes running out of the building and starts SCREAMING that the security guard is a pedophile and how dare he touch her daughter like that? She starts saying all sorts of shit, accusing him of being a rapist and threatening to have him hung, drawn and quartered.

The poor security guard looks like he wants to curl up and die.

I stepped in and told Karen what actually happened and the security guard probably saved Karen’s daughter. 

Karen then rounds on me (I’m South Asian) and starts claiming that I’m in league with the security guard and accuses me of being a pedophile too.

The receptionist comes out (a Filipina) and Karen screams she wants to speak to someone in-charge! She yells that she wants me and the security guard off the property immediately as we are pedophiles eyeing her daughter. At this point, I lost my temper and called the police.

Karen kept screaming at us and told me, “go ahead, call the police!” Police eventually show up and the first thing they do is look at CCTV footage where it is totally clear that the security guard saved Karen’s daughter.

I gave a statement to the police about all the awful things Karen was screaming about me and the security guard. Through the CCTV footage they can see Karen yelling, but can’t hear the words.

Once Karen saw the footage, she got very quiet and then denied that she ever said any of those things. Thankfully, the receptionist took a recording halfway through Karen’s rant and you can clearly hear all the awful things she was saying.

Then Karen totally changed her tune and started crying saying that seeing her daughter in danger she lost her mind and started apologising.

I told the security guard he would be well within his rights to file a complaint. I certainly told Karen that I told the police in my statement that I want to file a complaint against her for defamation and anything else the police come up with. She cried harder and the police officer encouraged me to settle the matter and the security guard caved and dropped the matter.

I said I’d think about it. This all happened about a week ago. A day or so after the incident, I went to the police and filed a complaint for defamation and harassment.

I guess Karen got a notification about it and she came to my apartment. She asked to come in, but I didn’t trust her to claim something untoward happened because we were alone inside, so I said I didn’t want to speak to her alone and she should speak to the police and I shut the door.

She started yelling that I needed to take back the complaint and banging on my door and I called security who eventually led her away. My neighbour in the apartment next door is witness to this entire scene.

But then her husband came by and he explained that she’s under a lot of stress after she lost both her parents to covid during the pandemic. He also begged me to drop the complaint. Even the police is recommending I settle. 

Should I settle and drop the case?

UPDATE #1

Her husband just came knocking again. I told him it’s 3AM and I have work tomorrow. He apologised but said that they cannot sleep because they’re so stressed because of the police complaint and they truly want to settle this and she’s very sorry. I asked him if he and his wife have apologised to the security guard and thanked him for saving their daughter? He didn’t say anything which I interpreted as a no. I told him not to come by my flat again and that I have no intention to settle. Whether she gets fined, deported or imprisoned, she deserves it for being a racist. He then started crying and saying they’re good people and his wife is not a racist, she’s made a mistake and he has no words to justify it but she’s not been the same since her parents died and he doesn’t know how to fix it. I basically herded him out of my flat and closed the door. Crazy effing shit. But now I feel really bad.

UPDATE #2

Thanks everyone for your kind words and support. I thought a lot about what to do today and decided to go ahead with the complaint for now. A good friend of mine is a criminal lawyer and I called him and explained the whole thing. He’s agreed to take on the case at cost. He’s added more complaints for assault and intimidation. He’s also told the police not to contact me, but only him. This way the police can’t pressure me to settle.

I also had another friend help me install a new camera near my door so I have evidence if they come back again. 

I spoke to the landlord’s office because I wanted permission to install the camera. The landlord’s company president called me. Once I told him my claim is going ahead, he said he will give me permission to install the camera. He also assured me that if I wanted, they would evict Karen and her family (apparently what she’s done with me wasn’t her first incident. She’s had issues with the landlord staff and has verbally insulted building cleaners and gardeners and tried to get people fired). I told the landlord can do whatever they want, but I don’t want to be the cause of someone losing their home. So I’m not sure if the landlord will go on to evict, but with the complaints against her and now a criminal case, the landlord may have cause.

Lastly I spoke to my lawyer tonight who said that in most cases, there’s only a fine. But in most cases all that happens is someone uses abusive language or shows the middle finger. In this case, it was constant abuse and then she lied and came to my home and tried to intimidate me. There’s a strong chance here she might get some (a month max) of jail time. But that is up to the judge.

In the meantime, she can’t travel and is stuck in the country until the case is resolved.

I spoke to the security guard today and told him  that if he changed his mind and wanted to file a complaint, I would support him and pay for my lawyer to represent his case. But he still didn’t want to go down that path, which is fine. I also thanked him for his bravery since he likely saved Karen’s daughter’s life and deserves to be praised. 

And that’s that. Now there’s nothing more for me to do but wait. It may take several months, but it doesn’t affect me.

Thank you to everyone again! This Karen is going to get her comeuppance!",45,"['karen', 'karens', 'guard', 'security', 'daughter', 'drop', 'husband', 'op', 'police', 'settle']",social_disputes/safety,0.99,1186,545,2022

Like every streaming provider Disney+ has a username/password login (in the rest of the world).

You log in and can select any language/subtitle available.

Netflix account works worldwide

AppleTV account works worldwide

Amazon Plus account works worldwide

Disney+ disregards the valid login, and demand I authenticate using the phone in UAE.

Worse:

So they artificially snubbed the service in UAE and the worst, since they use a non standard login methodology, you need new apps on all your devices.

So I have a Panasonic OLED TV for best possible picture. In my home country it has a Disney+ app.

In UAE, since they require a new app for log-in and Panasonic is not among the listed devices, I can't use my best TV for Disney+ here.

So artificial lack of content/languages

I know the UAE is officially a Muslim country and is populated by majorly muslims. Also before you attack me in the comments being secular doesn't not mean being anti Muslim.

It's just with the recent rules and regulations changing to be more westernized and modern do you think the UAE will make an official move to secularism?

The UAE changed its weekend to be more aligned with western countries for trade and business purposes. I've also seen a few months ago that the court will be prosecuting Muslim and non Muslim couples differently based on their religious beliefs. 

The UAE also misses out on a lot of tourism, money, and the ability to host big events yearly because they are perceived to be anti LGBTQ and oppress women among other things the west likes to pressure the gulf about. I personally doubt these things eill ever change if the UAE remains an official Muslim country...for obvious reasons.

The reason I'm asking this is because when I think about a country like Saudi Arabia or Jordan for example I'm like he'll naaaaw there is no way these countries will ever become secular but with the UAE I can see it...and that's not a bad thing, the UAE is a hub for a lot of western countries and connects the middle east with other countries so its not far fetched.

The main reason we should boycott them is not that they act as judge and executioner, but because the source code of their software is not open source. They might very well record all of your conversations and messages, you have absolutely no guarantee that your communications are encrypted, and they most probably are not. Same goes for Botim and other closed source apps, they are equally dangerous and should be ignored. Even if the companies behind are not malicious, the fact they are not encrypting our communications invites hackers to hack them and steal our information. 
    
Signal for instance is free, fully end to end encrypted and of course open source. WhatsApp is also end to end encrypted but not open source. Both Etisalat and Du are blocking them in order to promote their own crapware. Do not fall for it. They do not care about your privacy. The more you use their insecure apps, the less chance they are going to unblock the alternatives.

It's name was same as a multinational retail franchise operator except one letter was missing. For example, Lulu group being lul group. Thinking it's a typo, I accepted it with great pleasure.

I went there & the second I saw their logo on their glass office door my eyes popped outta my head. Not only the name was something else but the name itself was real suspicious. Not gonna say the name but the clue is it was a recruitment agency for females.

Went in, got the usual hateful envious eyes from other job candidates sitting on a sofa & went straight to the receptionist. Instead of asking for my name she frightenedly asked about my nationality. When I told her I'm seeing Mr. XYZ she became smiley as if it was password to a underground club & then she pointed to a room & said go go go. No fill this form, no please wait & have a sit sir. None.

I walked in & to my shock & confusion for the first time ever I saw 5 all female HR's & 7 candidates do interview at the same time & in the same room. Zero privacy, no standards & too noisy. Only one HR was handling 2 candidates at once & the HR's Looked nothing like HRs. They looked like HWs instead which stands for housewives. They were the typical mature indian aunties in sari that you see in lulu hypermarket all the time except for mine who looked like a near mature yoga instructor. Being used to seeing adult HR's in cocktail attire, I couldn't get anymore suspicious.

I sat down & she was the man I supposed to see. We started with hey how are you how's your day going. She didn't want to know anything about me. She didn't care about my strengths & weaknesses. She didn't even want to know why she should hire me. She just wanted me for myself.

She just asked 3 questions. Nationality, which job position & how much do I want. Once I told her, I don't know if it was because she liked me or she was too kind hearted, she tripled doubled the amount & offered it & upon hearing it my jaw dropped in amazement.

The salary was juicy as shit. It was 1500 AED more than what was on their job posting & the salary of 99% percent of people with ordinary jobs in UAE. Not to mention the benefits were like box of sweets. She talked more about the company than me. She then gave me a personal information form to fill & sign after which she told me I'd receive a call for training in 6 days.

Now it's been 9 days and I'm not sure whether to keep waiting or move on. She acted as if I was already hired before entering their office. I don't know, man. People said wait till the eid finishes. It's finished now & I still haven't got the call. I'm not sure if It's effective to call them. From what I saw It's a recruitment company with it's revenue being from the commissions they get for every staff they hire for other companies.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.6,2,18,2022

The reason is, the people I deal with on a daily basis in my line of work speak english in a very basic way, I have to talk like them in order to communicate properly. One time I decided to start talking to them in normal english, unfortunately it has failed as most of my instructions were not understood or misinterpreted, and they won’t tell me that they don’t understand my words so I come to know that after they screw up. Even sometimes I have to mix english with other languages to get my message through.

I am someone who has always been an advocate to support local businesses through Amazon

I decided to buy a MacBook Pro from noon, I didn’t want to buy from a random seller so I made sure the seller was noon. Here’s where I made a mistake, I clicked on an option to customize the product and added to cart. Little did I know that noon has changed the seller from themselves to a random seller.

The worst part is I brought it as a gift for a friend, which ended up being quite embarrassing for me as you could imagine, they opened the box infront of me and instead of a MacBook Pro there was a cut up box with a filthy laptop..

I spent countless hours calling them and communicating with noon support and yet it took them over a month to come to a decision where the investigation says we can’t do anything. At least give me something for closure, nope, nothing.

Now I pretty much wasted countless hours and lost 8k.

I’ve spent tens of thousands on noon this year alone, with minimum returns, mostly for very small products. I’ve bought appliances and many large items from noon and 3rd party sellers on noon.

Yet this is unfortunately how they treated me.
Can’t imagine how they would treat others then..

Worst of all the person who called me was completely powerless and had zero information on how the investigation was done. Couldn’t connect me with any higher ups, couldn’t give me any reason why return was declined.

My friends are trying to find out how they can get married in the UAE next year, but keep receiving mixed answers from everyone. 

The groom’s dad is Muslim, therefore they are assuming that on paper here in the UAE they will consider him Muslim (so far, we have found no record of any of his documents saying this). He is not religious at all and wishes for this to not be considered, but he is worried that this will limit his options (his name, and his parents being Muslim, does this give him more hurdles to go through if marrying a non-muslim?). 

Additionally, the couple have been told that if they have kids the kids will automatically be registered as Muslim, is this true?

I am assuming next steps would be to find out if on his visa or documents in UAE there is any record of him being Muslim, is there a way of finding this out? If there is no record, due to his name and parents when applying for a marriage certificate will this come up?

Can they get married in the UAE at all or do they need to go abroad?

2684,submission,w9v629,2022-07-28 04:43:10,"Home in Fujairah is completely flooded Absolutely devastated. There was a flash flood in Fujairah city. It all happened quickly, there was no warning. Only my old parents, sister and her 7 year old was home. We have been here for 40+ years, so we couldn't even imagine this to happen. Flood in this desert and heat? The water level rise rapidly, and the car floated away all in 10 mins. No authorities responded to us even as we kept trying. No one even in fujairah even knew what was happening. Or that areas in the city were dangerously getting flooded.


A dam was apparently breached causing the sudden water flow. I couldn't reach my family, and when i do all i could hear wear panicked screams and shouts from the other end. I was desperately trying to reach any authorities to get help, and finally i called up Dubai Police who told me they don't know and to call fujairah police. And neither Fujairah Police, nor emergency were even picking up the call. For 2 hours, i thought that i would never see my family. My father and my mother are both aging and are sick. Our neighbors, an old couple with one of them a heart patient. They were sitting on top of their dining table with no one to rescue.

The water rise was alarming and my father was worried with short circuit: got out of the house and half walk/swam for an hour. No police officers, helicopters or trucks. Nobody on the street. With God's grace, a kind man from auh who ended up in fujairah for work saw my parents trying to get to a higher plave. And helped them to safety. No rescue team. No amber alert. Atleast someone to pick up the phone.

I dont know what has happened. And how many are affected. But when help doesn't arrive on time, there is no point. My friend who lived 5 minutes away from my home wasn't aware that i almost lost my family today. No information on whats happening, or an notification.. I mean why was there no amber alert? Not one news publications has probably covered it and if they did.. There were 4 hours later. When they do, will they describe the utter horror people havr faced? Will it mention that a lot of family including us lost a lifetime worth of savings. I dont know how we can recover or if we can? Im grateful my parents are safe. But what the hell is next? 

Fujairah is a small city, does it make sense that one part of the city were posting stories of rain while the other were trying to rescue themselves from drowning?

You might have heard of Fujairah for its staycations spots and tourist places.. Fujairah is indeed a small city, but there are lot of people there too whose lives are precious. A lot of us lost a lifetime worth of savings. We dony know how to move forward. We have yet to process what has happened. So did many in other places northern regions. So please keep us in your prayers. And help us bring some semblance of normalcy back. We need your help.

Edit: i was informed by someone in navy that Its apparently a new water conservation dam build on top of the moutains near Al Qurayyah area? The water got filled due to the rain, and they opened it. In a few minutes, it was breached and the water was rushing out with heavy force.It must have taken 30 - 45 mins to reach the city.. But they didnt notify us. A reddit user had mentioned arroyos which could explain the breach? Not sure, but this is all the information i have. We all thought it was just normal rain water.

2689,submission,waw4d8,2022-07-29 09:21:25,"To do a fund transfer.. Last night, my friend (who has an account with CBD) desperately needed some cash. So he asked another friend to transfer it to his Careem wallet, which was credited right away, but when my friend tried to withdraw it, Careem informed him it would take one day to credit to his bank account. So he has asked me to transfer and warned me not to use Careem because it will take one day for the funds to reach his account, so we have started looking into other ways to transfer the funds. A friend told me that ADCB mobile banking can make instant transfers. Despite having an ADCB account, I do not have any money in it. My main account is with Liv Bank. 

The first thing I have to do is transfer money from Liv to ADCB, but transferring money from Liv to ADCB takes between 1 and 3 days. So the next option for me is to download a SimpyLife app (powered by ADCB) and add funds to the SimplyLife app from my Liv Bank and transfer to my ADCB then from ADCB  to my friend's account (Sigh). Therefore, I added funds to SimplyLife from my Liv account right away. My next step is to transfer that fund from SimplyLife to ADCB. I navigate to the fund transfer page and see 2.50dh charges. Now I need to add 2.50 to my SimplyLife wallet. So I added that 2.50dh from my Liv account and did the transfer to ADCB.

I then open the ADCB app, which is very slow and keeps giving me errors. I've tried opening this app at least 50 times without success. The next option I have is ADCB online banking. After successfully logging into my ADCB account from my laptop, I added beneficiary immediately and initiated the fund transfer option. I saw there was a charge of 1.05dh for this transaction. Besides the amount I transferred from SimplyLife to ADCB, which is the same amount my friend required, I have no balance in ADCB. Now I have to go back to SimplyLife and add 1.05 from Liv, then transfer that 1.05 to my ADCB with a charge of 2.50, so I must add 3.55dh from Liv to SimplyLife. Yes, I did that as well.

I then processed the fund transfer from my ADCB to his CBD successfully. But he didn't receive that immediately. I believe it took 6 hours or something for him to get it :(",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,1.0,5,14,2022

I am relatively young in terms of workplace experience, I've been in the work market for around 3 years. 

I am a software engineer, now I know that this market is sort of dominated by a specific nationality, I was not aware of the huge disparity before joining the workplace I didn't really care about the fact even after realizing. However, after joining the workforce and seeing the way people treat me, a guy who recently graduated, in the way that they would treat ""royalty"" is infuriating and just frankly pisses me off to no end. The way that as soon as I walk into a room everyone shifts their attention towards me and judges every move I make while fully staring into every fiber of my being, calling me ""sir"" when they are 3 pay grades above me. Dude, are you okay? Just call me by my name. 

I had many instances where I would ask my manager to go have a cup of coffee or breakfast or lunch outside company grounds, because we don't have a punch-in system at our company and I would stay extra if I exceed my allotted break timing , and upon returning I get stares and leers only for HR to contact me a couple of days later telling me that ""people informed us"" you leave the premises too often for their liking. I get confused because I ask my manager for approval, then I get the usual do you have an e-mail confirming this? Who would send an e-mail to let someone go for breakfast or have a coffee? I stopped doing that just to avoid people talking shit about me.

Then there is the fact that as soon as I meet a new person I get the usual ""yeah we know who you are, you are famous"" I literally sit on my desk and do my work while only interacting with my direct team members without any outside interaction, how do you know me?

Because of these random encounters and the way I get calls from HR saying people are saying this and that while I am completing my tasks and doing my job seriously makes me fucking pissed to no end. Add to that the fact that people think that ""local = big arbab"" it just adds to the pressure of expectations and the way people just have so much malice towards you, to the point that you can just see it in their eyes. 

At one point I was talking to an individual about how some locals have issues with the military service and if they don't abide they face legal issues, I got the usual ""Oh? Locals face legal issues? I thought you all lived carefree and got everything handed to you and didn't need to worry about laws?"" How am I supposed to respond to this statement? No matter what I say, I'm gonna be branded as the asshole.

Anyways, rant over I guess. I just felt frustrated and wanted to vent away somewhere. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.

I am moving to Dubai soon and would like to finance a G500 Mercedes. From what I saw, you need 20% down payment ✅ EID ✅ and 3 months salary’s ❌

I am moving as an investor at my own FZE. How does the credit system work? Would I be able to finance based on my ability to pay the down payment or would I need to generate income to a UAE bank account for 3 months first?

It seems I can’t finance anything for 2 years of owning a company which I don’t think is practical- I would also like to finance a house at 20% down payment within the year under the same circumstances

Anyone has experience with this? At the same time, anyone has an experience with not owning a car in the first place and going with Uber full time? 

Thank you

Edit: the car will be labeled under marketing expense to my business, not a personal expense. Please if you can not answer the question don’t tell me about what an asset it and what I should do or not..

Edit 2: My business is already established, running and successful. I will be able to generate the 3 months bank statement after opening a local bank account.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.53,5,40,2022

While practicing possible routes that could be used in the test with my instructor, we have to go through a shorter acceleration lane to merge into the main road.
He explained that once we reach the shorter acceleration lane, we have to slow down, look at the left side mirror and see if there’s opportunity to merge. If not, we stop, and if the lane is free we merge. Now when it comes to longer acceleration lanes, we have more space and time to speed up and see a gap to merge into so it’s comparatively much easier. When it comes to shorter acceleration lanes, I’m always instructed to slow down and stop if possible and then merge. I see other vehicles in front of me merging effortlessly. Just wanted to know if this is something we are expected to do as students and test takers and if stopping at the short acceleration lane would have any influence on the examiner. Don’t want him to think I’m “hesitating” to merge and then give a demerit point.

Insurance didn't give a thing as usual. Called for a car pickup and waited.
That's when a white Prado comes, suddenly flashing the siren (it was not a police car but a rounds car that checks the road activities). Two young cops, greets me, says not to worry and parks their vehicle way behind to secure the track with the siren.
They called for backup and after 5 mins, an actual police car (Patrol) comes and the Prado leaves.

Patrol again, assuring me not to worry, had some chat and waited with me until the pickup came.
Once the pickup boarded my vehicle and left, the cop asks me if I have any way to go home. I said I'll catch a taxi. They told me to enter their car, we discussed about our jobs, about our homes, and they dropped me almost near to the city where there are lots of taxis and told me they were sorry I had to got through all of this.

So I manufacture (very small business atm) decorative items for garden, landscape, interior. Such as statues, ornaments, antique-style frames etc. There is some photos of my items: [photos ->](https://imgur.com/a/FQPC7UA)  
I was visiting a lot of physical stores, discuss cooperation and managers that I was lucky enough to meet were happy to cooperate, because I'm not actually selling to them but left my items on commission base.

**BUT.** Currently out of \~50 stores (that were agreed for cooperation) only 1 store actually took my items. Others just went ignore mode for no reason. Items have very good quality, very attractive price, I'm offering a VERY! nice commission.

This is not a dead business segment, I know that for sure, there was a lot of marketing analyze behind.

What am I doing wrong at this point?

We already ordered from 2 different food chains when I remember that i want to use the coupon from carrefour receipt. I then decided to order pizza which cost me 15 dhs only after the coupon. I decided to have it for takeaway. 
While I was eating alone (my bf went to bathroom) I noticed a man sat on the other table in front of me. He didn’t order from any food chains. He looks tired. He opened his bag immediately and place the bread on the table. He opened it and ate directly. He was able to finish one half long bread in 5 seconds. I realized he’s that hungry. I looked around if he was waiting for a friend who ordered for him maybe but no one came. I felt sad. I remember the days when I would bring boiled eggs for my lunch coz that’s all i could afford. Before leaving, I looked at the pizza and decided to give it to him. I asked my fiancé to give it to him bcoz am too shy and didn’t want to offend him. I saw the smile in his face and felt good to have been able to help.

1. I use Airtel and Jio sim cards, do I need to do international recharge for recieving OTPs, which is needed while making payments online? Is there a need for international roaming pack or I'll recieve OTPs without it? 

[Note: I'll not be using those SIM cards for making calls, just need them for OTPs]

1. Google Pay usually takes location as registered information of the device while making payments, will I face any issues with that? It's Google Pay registered with India account used for making India payments.

Few years back they were pretty much unheard of and after COVID they seem to be everywhere. I have always been skeptical about them, but would love to hear feedback from actual users.

**UPDATE 1:**  As a first step, I got my air ducts, vents and filters thoroughly cleaned. I used Healthy Home ME. Costed me \~950 for a 2BHK,. but I think it was worth it. They used a crawling kinda vacuum hose which goes deep into the ducts with a rotating brush. They also wrapped all the surroundings with recyclable plastic and cleaned up decently. Still looking for a air purifier, but my nose has cleared up in 2 days after cleaning.

Hi Beautiful people,  


I hope you all are doing well. I am looking for a suggestion.  


I was looking for a new job and now I have been offered a job in Berlin by an employer.  


The salary is really not THAT great (and still under discussion). They are trying to match my salary in Dubai with a tiny bump, but, due to taxes on income, the money on hand at the end of the month is less.  
I am living with my wife in Dubai and we have a comfortable life; we can afford to live comfortably and also save a little bit (30%-40% of the salary) for the future.  


I started researching and checked a couple of videos and also read some of the blogs. After the calculations, I came to the realization that this will not be possible if I make the move dues to the income taxes. We won't be saving as much as we do here but we could live a comfortable life.

Here is where it gets interesting. Apparently someone from the immigration office didnt properly close her residency from 2017, which has been collecting fines since. And we had no way of knowing since all travel and new residencies/visas have been issued to her new UID.

HI. I am asking this on behalf of my daughter currently pursuing her UG and for the 2023 intake. Is anyone here in this forum pursuing their masters online? The reason I ask is because a reputed research university based in the UK and established in the 1960s is offering an online masters course in the area of her interest which can be completed within minimum 2 years and maximum 4 years. The modules look good and above all its within my budget ( cost around GBP.13K ) for the entire course.Also,she could work and study at her own pace.Considering my current employment scenario it will be a risk if I send her abroad to learn at that university and disappointing if I cannot fulfil her academic dream.

My question is, if it’s reliable to go ahead with online learning as the university is not KHDA approved since it does not have a physical presence here in the UAE.What are the challenges one could face going ahead with this option.

I am however worried about it being super crowded during the last week of the year (25th to 1st) so I'm considering going from the 17th to the 26th instead hoping it'll be less crowded. Unfortunately, this means missing out on the new years show.

It's my first time going there so Im a bit worried about long lines and crowded restaurants which is why I'm okay with missing out on the new years festivities if it means an overall better experience.  

My question is, is the city really less crowded during the week of the 17th than during the week of the 25th? Or is it pretty much the same so I should go for the last week of the year to enjoy the new year festivities??

Bear with me, this might be long, but I’ll try to make it a fun read. 

Context: I just started working at a marketing/ production agency two weeks ago - I was hired because of my experience in both fields, specifically studio photography, although the hiring process was unusual, tedious and unnecessarily long, I was still thankful for getting it. 

Was welcomed with a manager who does NOT know what a “handover” is - her role in being a manager or “account manager” to be more specific, is to let any new comers know that she’s the manager - basically she sucks at her job - big red flag. I don’t want to go through how she can’t properly translate Arabic to English “she’s an Arab btw” and “she’s managing an Arabic account” but moving on, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. 

Now back to the star sign. As much as I love girls, and their shenanigans. I hate working with full on female team. I was the only male in the team, and I knew trouble was around the corner, and trouble I shall have - from unnecessary drama, to inappropriate personal girly topics that I really didn’t need to hear or to be involved in. 

So, one of my coworker asked about my star sign, to which I replied late July. “Wow, you’re a Leo… me too”. My manager overheard the conversation, and chimed in with “you must be this or that” or whatever bullshit. Yes, I asked her, and she’s a hardcore horoscope fanatic, and I started noticing her shitty attitude towards me and it was clear how she reacted at that moment. 

I have done more than what I should’ve been hired for. Going from creating actual content, to creating marketing strategies. But at the beginning of this week I was hit with an immediate termination, and literally no valid reason behind it. All the extra work and value I have added was noticeably swept under the rug, and it really sucked. 

There are some details I don’t need mention on communication and the toxic owner and his lack of appearance in the office.

So I go there and buy one SIM, the guy tells me I can get one another for free. I said it's not needed and he claimed that if he doesn't give a free second sim then he has to pay 10 AED to the company, which I thought was a lie. I politely declined a few times but the guy suddenly scanned my ID while brushing me off and I got angry and told him to stop which he then only did. 

Could he have registered a second SIM without my knowledge? How do I check it/deactivate it. 

It was a prepaid SIM with no contract if that's relevant.

Hello

So we all know the status of the cars market now, all is on FIRE.

I haven't owned a car before and it's becoming a necessity and I can't delay it more.

My budget is around 40K and I have looked at something like Automall but with that price you won't get anything decent.

I'm  not looking at fancy cars or anything but the basic features like  cruise control for example which don't exist on the cars on that price  range in Automall so I started looking at Dubizalle and I'm searching  for used cars within that range and I found pretty good deals ( GCC ).

Now  let's say I found the car that I think it's good ( my opinion is not  that great because I've never owned a car before), but then what ?

I  go meet the owner then I should take it to a licensed garage, but where  are those garage located ? and what is the estimated fees and how much  time does this process usually takes ?

Also anyone recommend going to Souq Al Haraj ?

Hi everyone. I have a question about some messages I've noticed popping up on WhatsApp and reddit dm's recently? 

Recently, a few of my friends group have noticed that we've been receiving a lot of random messages on WhatsApp from different numbers all who start the conversation normally (hi, hello how are you etc) and then end up asking if we are active investors in crypto (after some random chit chat). All of these are women and almost all of them are from China or other East Asian countries and the numbers they message from are from different countries. Once we say no or don't show interest, they stop chatting.

One of these women asked us to invest into binance for example.

I've recently completed an MBA where I had the opportunity to engage in a lot of discussions around the 'circular' economy, and as this is still a nascent concept in the UAE, I've been thinking about something, and would love your input on if something like this would make sense.

With all the food waste going around, and having seen blue collar workers have bread and a cup of tea for lunch (around 2 AED) because that's all they can afford. I'm sure there's a way to tie these two together, and provide heavily subsidized meals to the workers from all the left over (amazing) food from breakfast buffets, lunch buffets and more.

From the way I see it, its a win-win, workers got top quality affordable meals, restaurants can push their ESG agenda while still making money.

Does this seem reasonable?

3003,submission,yk0l9c,2022-11-02 13:35:15,"Today, I may have heard the most BS thing that came out of a person's mouth from Dubai. But it could also be true. For context, I'm working in a software company where I am working as a creative director. I am also Filipino.

Earlier today, I had a call with the company owner. He talked me through a huge project that he wants me to lead in the near future. Basically, he's forming a new design agency company that he wants me to spearhead and set up from scratch. Then he pep-talked me about it and he mentioned how our past arguments made him think that I whine a lot and that he doesn't want that kind of 'negativity' in the future. For context again, the 'whining' part that he's talking about was when we had a huge argument when he had me migrate from the Philippines to Dubai and offered me a salary that is not proportionate to my position. And his reason back then was that I was Filipino. So I shouldn't expect to have the same salary as a westerner would get with the same job.

Back then, I just had to believe it because it was my first time migrating to a different country with a different culture. But as the years went by, I have had a lot of Filipino friends who are earning way more than me (I would say that it's almost or are already at the level of western designers of the same work experience) but are in positions that are lesser work responsibilities than mine.

So back to our call earlier, he reiterated his stance about the salary. To sum up what he said, he explains that if business owners in Dubai want to have employees with an American or Canadian mentality, they will have to offer huge salaries to move them from North America because they are already earning a lot there. But if they wanted people who have an Asian mentality like Indians or Filipinos, they only had to offer more than what they would earn in their home country to entice them to move to Dubai.

Now honestly when I heard that, I was offended and it could be the most BS thing I have ever heard from someone here in Dubai. But I can't help to believe that what he's saying is partly true.

But you know what's also true? Costs here don't vary depending on your passport. A 2 dirham Karak will cost 2 dirhams for a westerner and for a Filipino like me. My rent costs the same if a westerner was living here instead of me. I literally have no hate for Westerners. I have a lot of friends from America, Canada, and Europe. What I hate are these business owners trying to exploit and abuse an already problematic system.

To be honest, I feel like he knows that I can pull off this new project and it doesn't need any mentality from a specific race to make it happen. But he just wants to set my mind to not expecting a huge salary when I start running that company.

So now my game plan is to suck it up and let the new company kick-off led by me. Once the company has a decent portfolio for the first year, I will resign with a banger of a resume.

EDIT: Just wanted to be clear that I am going to continue leading the project even with shit pay because the opportunity to have that experience in my CV is definitely desirable. I can quit now and perhaps find a better job with better pay, but I can hold on for a year and lead the new design firm, then resign with an amazing CV that will surely give me a better career opportunity and definitely better pay. The experience that I will get just might break the racial walls towards me when I apply for a new company based on my achievements alone.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.95,366,245,2022

I have posted multiple times asking for advice when buying a used car, as this was my first time buying a car ever.
In this post I will mention a detailed experience that I wish I knew before buying the car.
This post will contain common-sense information for most people, but for people like me, it would be very useful.

# Searching for a used car
First of all, there are multiple places where you can find used cars, such as Dubizzle, Facebook Marketplace, and many other websites.
My first thoughts were to buy a car from Automall as they tend to have mostly good reviews, but the problem was that they were hella overpriced. I know that they have a warranty, but it's REALLY overpriced.
Second thought was to go to Harraj souq, but I have 0 experience in buying a new car so I was advised to stay away from Harraj.
I started looking for Dubzzle within my price range and looking at multiple brands, I was filtering to see GCC cars only.
But for my low budget I couldn't find but high-mileage cars so I looked at the most reliable cars such as Toyota and Honda.

# After you find the car that you think is good, then what?
1. Ask the owner for VIN number ( chassis number ) and search if it has any previous accidents and there are multiple websites for that :
https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/decoder/
https://driving-tests.org/vin-decoder/
https://vincheck.info/check/vin-check.php
https://evg.ae/_layouts/evg/trafficaccidents.aspx?language=en
https://www.carreport.com/AE ( I used the most )


2. Ask the owner if he has any service records. They don't have to be from the official showroom, for example, the car that I was inspecting was regularly serviced by AutoPro ( ENOC ) so I called them and pulled all of the service records based on the VIN number provided and, as It turns out the previous owner have done all of the major serviced for the car a couple of months ago and he changed the oil regularly and the car was well maintained, so that's perfect.


3. After that, if the car is good and you liked it, ask the owner for a test drive and garage check
The owner of the car that I found was located near Festival City in Dubai and I didn't want to drive too far for a garage, so I searched through Google Maps for the nearest garage with the highest reviews and planned to go there ( 4.5 rating with more than 1000 reviews ).
I agreed with the owner and went to the place to test drive and I had a list of things that I should check in the interior and exterior as well. I also had a list of things I should pay attention to during the test drive and all was good.
Then we went to the garage. They inspected the car well in an hour or so ( 150 AED charge ) and the report was clean as well beside some minor issue I managed to get a discount on.

# Registration process

1. First of all the previous owner had an Abu Dhabi license plate, and I wanted to have the car with Dubai license plates so we went for Dubai Tasjeel at first but they told us that we should visit Sharjah or Abu Dhabi to make the ownership transfer, if the car that you are buying have the same Emirate you just go to Tasjeel and transfer the ownership, both of you should have your Emirates ID with your and car Mulkia. Skip the next part if the car is within the same emirate.

2. We went to Sharjah with the car, and we removed the plates and parked it in a special place nearby for cars without plates, and we went inside and waited for an hour or something, then we made the ownership transfer, which would cost around 550 AED and that's it.
After that, you have to take the car to Dubai, but you can't drive it since that car doesn't have a number plate, so we had to take it with a recovery car ( there are lots of recovery cars there ) to take it to Dubai Tasjeel which costs around 120 AED. You have to take a taxi to get there as well ( 50 AED to the nearest Tasjeel in Dubai )

3. ( TIME SAVING TIP ) Car insurance should be present before registering the car and you can't register the car without it, the center in Tasjeel is overpriced so you better call YallaCompare and send them a copy of the ownership certificate that you acquire and your driving license and Emirates ID and they will give you the best insurance offer, pick the best one for you ( cost me 1000 AED less than the center in Tasjeel and more premium insurance ) and pay online using your card and the insurance will be activated to your car within an hour ( while you finish the car inspection ).

4. Now you are in Dubai with the car with no license plate so while you are waiting for your insurance, you should queue for the inspection and in my case it was like 1 hour of waiting and they inspected the car and gave you the report, then you park the car and go inside the building.

5. ( TIME SAVING TIP ) Check if your car needs oil change or air filter change or tier change or any other service because they have Autopro there and you can change the oil there as well while you are making the registration inside ( Autopro might be overpriced but if your services are not big it won’t make that big of a difference )

6. Inside the building, take your inspection result and queue for the registration. They are really fast, don't be afraid if you see a lot of people. After that they will check your insurance from their system which YallaCompare should confirm to you that your insurance is online and they will take the new ownership certificate from you and they will ask you if you want big or small number plate so you have to check with your car first and here you will pay registration fees which is around 420 AED.

6. After that you will take your vehicle license from another window and your new number plates as well, don't buy the plastic thing for the number plates unless your car needs it because they are expensive.

7. After that you should buy a new Salik card AND ACTIVATE IT through the app or website. You can buy it from there as well ( 100 AED ), comes with a 50 AED balance as well.

8. Go to your car and remove the old Salik sticker and put the new one and then you will find a guy that will put the new number plate on your car ( 30 AED )

Congratulations, you have now registered your first car in the UAE.",19,"['car', 'tesla', 'cars', 'nissan', 'patrol', 'batrol', 'charging', 'ev', 'sunny', 'lexus']",vehicles,0.92,22,8,2022

I was advised to post this here after my Original post in [r/abudhabi](https://www.reddit.com/r/abudhabi/)

Long story short- I cant get a clean health card to go back to my home country as air travel is no-longer an option for me, meaning I'm currently stuck in Abu Dhabi for the time being (Until I give birth). My husband who is a long-time resident of Al Ain wants to sponsor me and our Child (And our soon-to be child). He went to his boss and asked if any positions making more money are available, as he's Just under the sponsor amount. Later he was called into HR and told that employees are not allowed to sponsor family visas while working for the company (even if they make enough) and If he's caught trying to do so, he will be terminated.

We are at loss as we cant seem to get any other visa at this time, and this was our last option. No one will even look at my resume, and we've been applying for many other jobs for him with no luck.

Is this even Legal?

Do you have any other paths for visas we may not have considered? there seems to be nothing but road blocks at every turn now, and I'm frustrated and kinda panicked now...

Edit:: A ""clean health card"" is when Airlines ask passengers with Obvious health issues (In most cases-including mine-Visibly pregnant people) to provide papers from a doctor stating that they are safe to travel by air. you have to be before 36 weeks with no other issues. I'm before 36 weeks, but at my check-up during my visit they found a complication and none of the doctors I've seen will clear me (For good measure, but still) and airlines won't let me travel back until the issue is resolved. (i.e. baby is born)

I'm going to keep it short and vague/anonymous to start, but happy to provide more details upon request.

I'm an Arab self-made talent in his early 30's that has won multiple international awards for his technology innovations in one of the major in-demand fields of technology today that Dubai is seeking talent in, with one of my more prestigious awards having been earned from Switzerland. That being said, I was born and raised in Kuwait (I'm not from there), and know that my life and potential is being wasted there, especially with all the racism and talent suppression I experience on literally a daily basis. (Long story, but for a glimpse I've had everything done to me during my technology innovation and entrepreneurship journey, from being excluded and ostracized against based on my non-Kuwaiti nationality to having my previous company and its money - 2 million AED worth - stolen from me by my ex-Kuwaiti ""kafeel"" without the ability to fight him back due to wasta). That being said, I harbor no hate, I just want to bury the hatchet and move on to a place that appreciates me and what I have to offer - a place where I can thrive, as well as contribute to and MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON.

I know for sure that within the Arab world, Dubai is the one place where I belong. I know I have a lot to contribute to Dubai and its vision, and I would love to get noticed and relocate there. I would like a chance to just demonstrate what I have. A chance to get judged.

Can anyone help me? I just want a chance to present and tell my story, vision, and potential contributions. I know this is a longshot - a message in a bottle - but I'm going to take every shot I can take until I succeed.

Once again, happy to share my story, achievements and challenging journey in more depth upon request.

I don't live in Dubai, I am currently visiting my dad so I am living with him and my mom for a month. My mom permanently shifted to Dubai a year ago. My dad has been living here for about 8 years now. 

The first thing I noticed when I got here was how much of a miser my dad is. I knew he made bank, wasn't sure how much. I found out he makes about 35,000 AED per month. Not sure if that is a high amount in this country but it seems like it, especially without taxes to worry about. He lives in Al Nahda, Sharjha. This place is dead. There is absolutely nothing to do here except wake up, go to work, go to the gym (which most of them suck) and come back home. He eats from the same 2 restaurants whenever they order in. He does not spend money on clothes, my mom and I had to force him to purchase a decent pair of Nike sneakers to wear outside. He only buys extremely cheap shorts and crappy tshirts to wear on the regular. His office clothes are decent because my mom shops for him a lot whenever she goes back home. He gets cheap shitty haircuts from someone in the area and refused to go to a nice barber until I forced him last week. Where he complained throughout the whole afternoon about the cost. 

He does not even invest the money or purchase other assets. His entire savings (in Millions) is in the bank. What annoys me the most is that he does not hesitate to spend money on my mom or me. My mom LOVES to shop and she only buys stuff from expensive brands. So whenever we go shopping she spends freely and he never complaints about it, instead encourages. His behavior is the same towards me. 

Now I know that everyone must be thinking, that I have such a great father where he only wants to spend for his family. That's the thing, my mom and I make good money ourselves. I've lived in another country for the last 6 years and I (26M) make about 140k AUD. That is more than enough for me and I live a life of semi-luxury, since my girlfriend also makes a decent salary and we mostly share expenses. My mom quit her job last year (She's 52) but she has made enough money in her life that she doesn't worry about major expenses anymore. Neither of us ask my dad for any money. My dad gives my mom about 5k each month for household expenses. She saves most of it and that's her small little piggy bank. Most of her money is in India which she has invested in various buckets. 

Is this the general trait of men living in UAE? And how can I talk to my dad about changing his attitude/behavior towards money. I also feel guilty because of how well I live in Australia and think I am doing something wrong. I don't plan on taking any money from my parents for my expenses. They have their wish of buying me a house when I get married, but that's still too far away in the future for me. I've tried to talk them out of it but they are adamant. Even with the expense of the house, they don't need to save this vigorously. 

How should I approach this? Or should I just leave it be? My mom agrees that the area they currently reside in is not that great in terms of cleanliness and amenities. She is waiting for their lease to end in a few months and then will have them move somewhere in Dubai. I am also open to recommendations for area you'd suggest which would cost about 75,000-85,000 AED for a 2 bedroom, or 50-60k for a one bedroom. 

I apologize if this post comes off as rude. I don't mean it to be. I love my dad and want him to enjoy life to a certain extent. I don't want him to be 75 and only have memories of working and gym in his mind. I plan on gifting them a trip to Italy next year. I'll pay for the entire trip prior to their departure so they cannot back out of nice hotels and stuff.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.47,0,57,2022

I assume it doesn't stem from rich and poor mentality. I could be wrong though. But it would be interesting to hear from everyone.

Here's my reason to hate Sunny :

1)  I don't hate all Sunnys out there. I just hate that particular 2012- 2021 model Indian Sunny.

Nissan made a ridiculous design that made it look like a car from the 1960s. Most of the Nissans from this era is terribly designed, maybe with the exception of Xtrail or facelifted Y62.

If it's a matter of money, people could by cars in the similar price range that looks way much better than that hippo on wheels.

2) Slow drivers - this doesn't need an elaboration. Mostly people who just got their license starts with the car they comfortable with already.

I had earlier done some research online at TripAdvisor and r/dubai but did not managed to get all my questions answered. Hopefully, this sub would be the key this time round :)

Just to give some background, my interests are museums, historical sites, zoos, and sightseeing. I definitely won't be spending much time in shopping malls.

1) tourist SIM Card: I am looking to buy a tourist SIM card at Dubai International Airport when I arrive. I had done my research and do far, it seems Du is the best telco provider.  Just to check, there are no e-SIM cards for tourist arrivals, is that right?

2) I understand that it will be the UAE National Day Friday, 2 December. Would attractions at the neighbouring city of Abu Dhabi still be operating on that day? I have been looking at several tour agencies on klook that provide day trips to Abu Dhabi but for some reason, the Lourve Abu Dhabi is not on the itinerary for most of the day trip packages in klook. I am also considering other travel websites too.

3) is there a area/location in Dubai where tour agencies tend to cluster around? The Klook travel website is usually my go-to when travelling overseas and booking a day trip but I am trying to see if I could get a cheaper deal too.

4) travelling to Abu Dhabi from Dubai (via bus): according to my resesrch online, i would have to take RTA's E100 bus, which  departs from Dubai's Al Ghubaiba Bus Station that brings me on a 2-hour journey to Abu Dhabi's Al Wahda Bus Station. Would anyone happen to have any alternative recommendations?

My last question is a bit out there. I am a bit of a foodie but also travelling on a relatively budget. I was just wondering if anyone have recommendations for local must-try eateries.

Exactly what the title says. Yes, there are dedicated cycling tracks, and Dubai has the world's longest cycling track (Qudra), but that's just for enthusiasts. For actual commuting, cycling is not the best.

Firstly, cycle thefts are not taken seriously by the authorities. I've had multiple friends get their bikes stolen, and yet the police won't do anything about it because of a lack of footage or whatever. This is in a densely populated area with people around the clock, directly opposite the DPHQ. And it's right under a metro station and has plenty of shops nearby. There are supposed to be plenty of CCTV cameras. However, why is it necessary to be concerned about parking your bike anywhere? Even in dedicated bicycle parking areas, cycles get stolen.

There is no feeling of security if you park your bicycle. You might say that the UAE isn't meant for cycling, which is true in a lot of places. But there are also plenty of areas where there are a lot of cyclists using them to commute, especially in Karama and other places with cycling lanes. Even in broad daylight.I have also seen people getting their bikes stolen by others just walking out the building with their cycle from the basement or even right in front of their flat.

This is just about bike theft; actually commuting to anywhere outside 20 to 30 minutes of your area is not the best because of highways and bridges, but you can't really do anything about that. Dubai, and the UAE as a whole, could be better to cycle around, but stopping even for a small break at a mall is stressful.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.92,10,8,2022

Quite often because we are too exhausted to stand up for yet another hour to get to our destination, we scurry to the connecting joint of the metro and sit there.

Yesterday an angry lady and her friend mumbled something horrid about us and we ignored them, but as she was about to move out, she intentionally kicked my friend real hard and didn't apologize.
My friend let out a 'what the' in confusion and frustration and this lady just started yelling, like mindlessly. We ended up having an argument, with her mainly asking us to 'grow up' while I told her to 'not raise your volume at me and speak respectfully' (to which, btw, she replied that 'i will yell because it's not getting into your stupid brains')

Yesterday, I visited Abu Dhabi on a day trip via the Airport Express Bus from Ibn Battuta Station to Abu Dhabi Main Bus Terminal. The total trip each way took close to 1 hour  45 mins. I visited and toured around the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, Qasr Al Watan, Emirates Palace Hotel, and the Souk Central Market at World Trade Center.

Unfortunately, I couldn't make it to the Lourve because it turned out to be closed on Mondays.

I was thinking of making another day trip on either this Thursday or Friday (I am flying off on Saturday). But I know that the UAE is holding National Day celebrations on 1st Dec (Thursday) and 2nd Dec (Friday).

I am a little worried about road closures and that it might disruption my journey. I asked the local residents at Abu Dhabi yesterday (shopkeepers and taxi drivers) if there are any planned road closures for the celebrations, but nobody seemed sure.

The journey back and forth between Dubai and Abu Dhabi is a little long for me, so I am wondering if I should just write-off visiting the Lourve this time round amd spend my Thursday and Fridays doing other things in Dubai.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,1.0,1,2,2022

The car is in it's 8th year and I have been servicing with them ever since I bought the car brand new.

I have a feeling that they caused the damage, maybe not intentionally. Could the mechanic who did the test drive have been careless? Even during the previous service, I got the car back with an engine oil leak, which I noticed and broght it in right next day, which they fixed. Apparently they do quality tests after service but missed this?

They also said I would need my brake discs replaced the next service but it's all good when I got the report back this time.

**history**

I've got this idea that there is no convenient way to stay in touch with the numerous events in Dubai. Groups in social networks, events calendar on visitdubai, news - it's just too much to follow. And what makes it worse, it's not handy to use. ""Saved"" messages in social networks are lost and forgotten, calendar and apps like meetup.com have just too much garbage. So I [asked guys](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/z68pza/i_want_to_make_a_free_events_in_dubai_appsite_but/) on another subreddit what do they think about the idea of simple events tracker app... Well, they've asked for it (and even offered help).

**to the point**

10 or something days later we released sort of MVP of the project: [melme.io](https://melme.io) \- people just submit there events, when they hear about them, and everyone can see it. No registration, no nothing. It's easy to use, only minimalistic design with all the needed information to attend.

**so what**

Nothing. Lol. I hope you like it and use it. Of course, it's missing some important features right now, like map view, notifications about the events, reviews on the organizers and other stuff - but with community power it's just a matter of time till all of it is gonna be done.

With New Year coming, number of the events grows every day. Be sure to not miss anything.

Got my cars registered here and now before getting number plates we must add insurance. Turns out to be a major problem to find one that is not very lacking. Price is generally looking ok, but.... jesh.

Any recommendations? We talk higher powered higher value non GCC spec car, BMW's (multiple).

My main issues I have so far is:

* The insurances I am offered do not cover ""agency repair"" after some years. This is nice, except for 2 things: One, I have no real intention letting some mechanic running on a 2019 BMW that he has likely only limited knowledge of. More...
* The insurances I am offered instead have a list of garages they work together. This is nice in theory, but I am seriously wondering whether any of them is prepared to deal with a higher end and quite rare hybrid sports car. Hybrid in general require a lot of additional knowledge (suddenly car mechanic turns into high voltage specialist - there is a LOT of power in those 15kwh batteries) and in case of one of my cars I am sure that even opening the front hood without breaking it would be outside their knowledge. And being rare the chance they have seen one (it being involved in an accident) is astonishingly rare. Sports hybrids are rare and quite special and the idea of some run the mill garage doing the cheapest repair possible on something a finely tuned system like that gives me creeps. There seems to be no way to add agency repair to the policy regarding of age and/or to at least get the money and then have the repair done BMW with the insurance paying he original quote (worsts case, but seriously, in case of accident I want the best job possible).
* I just read the conditions and welding, tightening OR CUTTING on the carrying parts of the car would automatically trigger a declaration of the car as being non-repairable. Now, I understand that for normal cars - you really do consider a car where someone had to remove the A column a salvage. The problem is that one of my cars has a modular glued carbon chassis. Carbon does not deform - it absorbs (a lot of energy), then breaks. Because this cannot be repaired, the chassis is modular and glued together and the idea is that you cut (with special tools at special places) the broken parts out and glue replacement parts in. So, I get it on the front left by another car, the carbon part breaks off and instead of replacing it as planned (and not that expensive) the whole car is suddenly automatically salvage. SERIOUSLY?

It hurts me that immigrants who work so hard to stay in the UAE can't have the benefit of a guaranteed future here. And the children of immigrants who basically have no other place to call home are eventually gonna have to leave. I've lived in the UAE for my entire life, I can't even speak my parents' language, and yet I'm classified as a foreigner. I get it, the Emiratis wanna preserve the culture, but it still hurts yk?

What if the UAE had two types of passports, one for Citizenship by Blood (CBB), and another for Citizenship by Naturalization (CBN)? 

CBN passport holders can have lesser benefits than those who have CBB passports, but when travelling abroad, they are considered citizens of  the United Arab Emirates and can get the same visa benefits. 

Now things can get pretty complicated if one parent has a CBB passport, while the other has a CBN passport, and they have a child. But I'm sure that things can be figured out. 

In conclusion, I'm not expecting this to be a real thing. I'm still grateful for the safety, opportunities and memories this country has given me. But yet again, it can't hurt to dream, could it?

3183,submission,zw2bz8,2022-12-27 05:02:44,"Company Bank Account Complications - Sincere Advice and help needed. Hello everyone! 

I am asking on behalf of my friend who is the owner of the company. 

Freezone Ajman Freezone Company opened in 2020 with no bank account.

The Ajman Freezone Company was opened with intention of starting a new business In January 2020 - Unfortunately as you all know Covid Lockdowns hit us around March 2020 and the owner of the company who was out of country couldn’t travel first due to restrictions and then he fell seriously ill with a Covid related problem and he couldn’t travel till just last month November 2022. On his behalf I did try to open the Bank Account but I neither am a partner or signatory hence all banks refused to do so and asked that owner visit UAE. Regardless of his medical condition he came to UAE last month. We went Ajman Bank and shockingly they straight out refused to open an account saying the company is older then 6 Months -Our explanation and all requests went in vain as they weren’t willing to cooperate at all. Later we went to two other banks which again refused for similar reasons. Finally we tried our luck with DIB - and went for a Corporate Account advised by the manager at DIB itself. 
All things seemed to finally be going okay. All the documents needed were submitted, we shaked our hands with the RM and he did give us a hint that no complication should occur since all are documents such License/Visa/MOA etc were in order. The owner finally relaxes and travels back. 10 days later we get a call from the RM that since we only have a flexi desk in the Ajman Freezone and not an office - The process has halted and “It’s an issue of compliance”

This has just been utterly frustrating for us considering the RM at DIB gave us a clear green signal. We’ve invested money in the opening of the company and renewing it every year and also the flexi desk we pay for. The owner had a medical condition hence the delay. But how in anyway is this fair that banks are so hesitant to open a Freezone Company’s Bank Account. I can assure you the business we intended with it has no issue whatsoever as it is as simple and clean any business can get. No Bank so far has given that anything from our side seems sketchy. But everyone has hinted that opening Freezone Company Accounts has been a hassle this year. 

I am looking for advice from people who work in Banks and would genuinely be grateful if anyone can guide us from here. My DMs too are open and anybody willing to help would do us a huge favor.

Thanks!",14,"['bank', 'card', 'credit', 'scam', 'money', 'banks', 'account', 'booking', 'loan', 'scammers']",banking_financial_services_fraud,0.83,3,15,2022

3188,submission,zy66nd,2022-12-29 18:04:33,"Enough with the constant posts on lane hoggers vs tailgaters. It's not that difficult guys. This GD topic every 5 mins.

Let's be real. Dubai is a melting pot of a lot of different cultures, educution levels and ideals, it makes a mess of things like road etiquette. The simple truth is that in more even societies you don't get this issue.

We all know that some people from some cultures can be meek and timid, and either choose to not understand the rules or flat out do not have awareness. Some people from other cultures feel that are better educated and should have more rights on the road and can be bullies. Some people are from places where life is considered cheap and take excessive risk. You cant de-educate people and asking people to share this space is a challenge.

So unless the government drill down on the dummies that they let on the road this will always be a problem, but they won't because they need people fast tracked onto the road to keep the economy moving. You couple that with a significant gaps in privilege and deep levels of subjugation, then again, you're asking for a mess. 
 
However I don't like the police telling people to move out of the way for faster cars because its too ambiguous. Its lazy and doesnt do anything to tackle the issue. At times its just not practical and you're arming the bullies. I'm sick of having to defend myself for going with the speed of traffic in gridlocked situations like rush hour. It's proven that switching lanes in this instance actually slows traffic down. Flashing your lights and bullying your way through gridlock is an asshole move. Every lane must be utilised, including the inside lane shock horror, and your time is as precious as mine. But yes, on empty roads there's no excuse for lane hoggers. I am happy to move over for people when it's safe and easy to do so. I get just as frustrated with these people equally.

But theres no excuse for tailgaters at any time. Choosing to place your vehicle in an area of the road that you cannot control, following someone so close that you cannot react in an emergency, is basically willful negligence with a deadly weapon. You are literally taking a gamble that you will not need to emergency stop. You're playing with people's lives. Those in big heavy cars doing it to light cars that require a much longer stopping distance, this should be an immediate criminal offense. You would absolutely total that small car and gravely risk the passengers. I'd immediately ban such people from the road. 

There is no question that tailgating is by far the more serious and dangerous offense. It is the absolute worst of these evils. Think out there on these roads, we all have families that want us back in one piece. We need to be kind to each other and get on with it.",1,"['dubai', 'uae', 'arabic', 'people', 'sharjah', 'country', 'abu', 'dhabi', 'emirates', 'like']",uae_cities_region,0.63,22,16,2022

I turned around to the bus driver to see what was wrong and he look at me with a very irritated face. And then he just spat something in Hindi and asked if I had been sleeping in a very demeaning way before he resentfully opened the door for me.

I can understand that it was rush hour and he was in a hurry, but that's not a reason to insult. This is the first time for me on an RTA bus.

You move over and then someone else comes up and flashes you on the furthest right lane. Are you just supposed to keep moving incessantly?

Or sometimes I am on a bridge to get to another road that has a sharp curve or exiting a parking garage and going as fast as I safely can and people flash me.

This post was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/10dd9br/whats_your_dubai_hack/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/10dd9br/whats_your_dubai_hack/)

I have listed down some random life hacks or facts that you could use if you are new to Dubai / UAE.

## Useful

- 7275: Dubai parking, `<numberplate> <area code> <number of hours>`

  - example: `T17362 331A 2`

- 5566: Sharjah Parking, `<emirate code (DXB, SHJ, AUH, etc)> <number> <number of hours>`
  - example: `DXB 17362 2`

## Random (but useful)

- Setup your **UAE Pass** account and make your life a bit easier

- **Pay your traffic fines on December 2nd**, because of the national day there will be some discount (source: friends, news)

- Get a **Nol card**, public transport is WAY cheaper than cars. For example, getting to work using a cab is AED 32 for me, and by metro, it's AED 3.

- If you are looking for new furniture, a car, or electronics (or planning to sell them), and you are low on cash to get a brand new one, just check the same item on **Dubizzle** and see if it's available there. I have sold a couple of things and bought a few things, there are some weirdos out there in Dubizzle but just be mindful of it.

- If you want to see what all is happening in Dubai, [Visit this](https://www.visitdubai.com/en/whats-on/dubai-events-calendar?tags=Leisure+events)

- **If you have completely remote work (all 5 days WFH) and you want to save up on money** and you don't care much about living in big cities, **Live in Sharjah**. It's WAY cheaper than Dubai. The basic rule of thumb is the further you get away from Abu Dhabi and Dubai the cheaper the rent is.

- **CALL the restaurant and order directly** from them if they have drivers, Zomato (RIP), Talabat, Noon, and Instashop keep as much as 20-30% of the order. The restaurants really appreciate it if you could just call and order from them. AND ALSO it's cheaper than ordering it from the app.

- Spinneys and Lulu have a salad bar, I have been buying from there for a good 3-4 months now, and it's amazing, it's cheap, healthy, and filling at the same time.

- If you want to drink with friends, do it at home it's exponentially cheaper to buy alcohol and have a small party at home than go to a bar. [This comment that I wrote before](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/10dd9br/comment/j4ozq7v/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
- Guide to buying alcohol
  - If you are in Sharjah: Unisat
  - If you are in Dubai: MMI or Windmill (Ghantoot)
  - Other places: The Original Barracuda (UAQ)

## Be careful

- One of the worst traffic fines is hitting a pedestrian and jumping a red light. Jumping a red light can give you 12 black points and impounding the car for 30 days (AED 3000 to take it out of the impound)

- Be careful of your Salik account balance, you only have 10 days to refill your Salik balance, otherwise, it's AED 150 fine.

- Speaking about fines, here are [ALL THE TRAFFIC FINES](https://www.edarabia.com/dubai-police-traffic-fines/) there are 140 different ways to get traffic fines in Dubai <3

- NO PDA ALLOWED

- Dubai is a relatively safe city, Just be careful in areas that are away from the main cities... places like Deira, Naif, Karama, International City, and Bur Dubai, have a very bad rep on it being not-so-safe, so please be mindful especially if you are a solo female traveler.

- If you are good with money get a Credit Card, My friend uses a Liv Credit card and he made a lot back (around AED 2400 in a year). I use ADCB and their cashback is not that great. So pick and choose a good one.

- BE VERY CAREFUL about Instagram shops in Dubai, I got scammed twice and got very shitty products.

- If you work in Dubai and live in Sharjah, beware of the 40mins+ traffic you have to go through, you might think it's okay initially, but it will have a huge effect on your mental health and your time in general.

- BUY FUEL-EFFICIENT CARS, fuel is really cheap here, and getting a fuel-efficient car will save you a lot of money.

- Don't insult any religion (especially Islam), or culture or mock anyone UAE takes very strict actions against that.

## Useful Apps (maybe):

- **Dubai Now**: This app lets you basically pay for everything, I pay my DEWA, Home Internet, Mobile bills, Traffic Fines, Nol, and Salik ALL WITH ONE SINGLE TAP. I can't believe many people don't know about this app.

- **Dubai Police**: To report crimes, See / Pay for your traffic fines

- **Carrefour, Noon Daily, Instashop**: My favorite is Instashop and Carrefour, these apps will allow you to order groceries at home and they reach in 30-40 mins.

- **UAE Pass**: After you set it up, your login process for Dubai Now, DEWA and AlHosn, and all that become WAY easier.

- **Zofeur**: Are you a bar/pub person, and you always end up drinking a bit too much and have to risk your life to get to your house? Use this app, A dude will come to your car and drop you home. It's kinda expensive, but not as expensive as a cab.

- **UrbanCompany**: Home Service App, From part-time cleaners to handymen for plumbing, electrical, etc to PCR tests at home to even A BARBER AT YOUR DOOR to HOME SPA TREATMENT to PEST CONTROL, this has almost every service you need (other apps to check are Rizek and JustLife which provides something similar)

- **PropertyFinder & Bayut**: Apps / Websites where you can rent or buy property, Personally I like property finder cause of the UI and the filters. (and they don't mind WebScrapping unlike Dubizzle and Bayut)

- **Entertainer**: Excellent discounts & offers on meals or drinks from restaurants.

- **Waze**: I stopped using google maps and started using Waze, ONLY cause it shows where the radars are, I learned my lesson by paying almost AED 6000 last year for speeding fines :))) This year I only have 1 ticket, because of Waze. (or you could just drive like a normal human)

- **Sarwa**: Robo Investing app, I have been using this for a year now, and it's AMAZING, the customer support is also very amazing, they reply in like 10-20 mins and keep the conversation going. I usually never trust these apps, but since I have been using them for over a year, I love them.

- **Tabby and Tamara**: Monthly payment plan, even with a Debit card, I bought every single piece of furniture from IKEA using Tabby and it was amazing, helped me NOT dent my wallet.

## When getting an apartment...

- ...make use to get on close to public transport **if you don't have a car**, cause walking to a further away metro station might be okay now (cause its Jan), but in June, July, and August, it's not going to be fun, you will reach your office all drenched in sweat.

- ...talk to the people in the building and understand the issues that you might have to face so that it doesn't come as a shock or you can prevent it from happening.

- ...take a photo of everything BEFORE you sign the Ejari and pay the security deposit. Because sometimes something might be broken and they won't give your security deposit back (many of my friends faced this issue here)

They have videos in Dubai and UAE, There are many others like Mo Vlogs and Money Kickz, but I don't like their content, it's very pretentious and annoying in my honest opinion. I like videos that show UAE for what UAE is, its traditions, cultures, and also a bit of the rich side. (if you guys know any channels do let me know)

I am a 24 yr old DJ with 2 yrs of Live experience and have been performing in private events between Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Lebanon. I have been passionate about music since my childhood (Abu Dhabi born and raised) and only came back recently to UAE.

Multi-Genre (Open Format) music is what I spin with speciality in R&B. I know how to make a great atmosphere and read crowds properly!

The things is, I feel I can handle more events and residencies here in UAE and am looking for more people to work with. So, what do you guys think, anyone wants to or knows someone who’d want?

I can share my portfolio and Instagram also.

3279,submission,10nd75l,2023-01-28 15:42:24,"How do you deal with other men lusting over your wife? Dubai - for all the known reasons - has far more men than women. Some of these men rarely interact with women and probably haven't been with one in a long time. I am not condoning the behaviour, but I realize there are urges hard to ignore.
What tends to happen is that they stare (blatantly and for a long time) or comment amongst themselves whenever a girl/woman walks by and they do it even when we are walking together. Most of them make no effort to be inconspicuous. Even if I look at them directly in the eyes, it rarely deters them and in fact it seems very close to become a verbally/physical confrontation.
Being harassed on the street is a common complaint here for single or unaccompanied women and it is taking a toll on my wife as she avoids being by herself as much as she can. She doesn't feel unsafe, just too much observed.

Anyways, how do you deal with this? Do you just ignore it all together, say or do something? I also come from a country where this behaviour is not tolareted by the girl's SO, so the lusting is done out of sight, which really doesn't make it any better.

3303,submission,10t6wdq,2023-02-04 10:19:22,"The Value of a Dirham An article I had written when I was younger. Still resonates with me now.

The Value of a Dirham.

It was quite late at night. I believe my parents had taken me to another one of those Bengali get together where recipes are exchanged; literature discussed; debates are sparked over colonialism; requests made for someone to sing for the group met with reluctance, finally ending in acceptance; old uncles reminiscing over their childhood and a few other things that I shall save for a later article.

Anyway…where was I? Oh yes… It was late at night. Don’t worry, nobody gets killed. 

My father had just hailed for a taxi, which promptly stopped in front of us. The driver lowered the passenger side window and asked my father where he wanted to be driven. A quick nod later, my mother and I got in the back and my father took the front seat. The driver was a ‘pathaan’. A pathaan is a term loosely used in Dubai to identify people who are from the North-Western part of Pakistan and Afghanistan. He had a salt and pepper beard that was quite fascinating and spoke in an accent I, at that age, found rather amusing… still do, truth be told.

As I held my mother's hands asking her innumerable questions, only to be met with a tipsy yes or no, I saw the pathaan looking at me from his rear-view mirror. I was quite startled by that. I wanted to ask him to look at the road ahead instead. But at that age, when a towering pathaan looks at you, there’s not much that can be done. With my mother clearly not entertaining my sudden mood for an impromptu quiz session; I started bugging my father. Random questions followed. My father did entertain a few questions at first, but he too started looking busy, possibly giving directions - “Seedha… Dayne….Phir bayne….haan haan… roundabout left, service lane right, oh! What a night…”, clearly inspired and motivated on successfully passing his Dubai driving licence test (It is a tough exam).

As the car drew closer home, I continued to see the pathaan’s eyes staring back at me, me plumped on the seat feeling dejected by the lack of excitement shown by my parents in answering my questions. I looked out of the window, tried to count the passing light poles. It was too difficult. I started humming instead, noting down the number of cars that passed us, and tallying them against the number of cars that we passed, an activity that keeps me occupied till date. Finally, the car pulled up in front of our apartment. My mother and I got out and stood on the pavement, letting my father pick up the tab for this journey. My father handed the pathaan a ten Dirham note, the exact fair that was payable. He took it, held my father’s hand and slipped something in it. 

My father got out, looked at us, slightly taken aback, walked over to us and opened his palm. Resting on his palm was a one Dirham coin. He then went on to explain that the pathaan had given him a Dirham coin so he could buy a can of soda for me. “Do not accept anything from strangers”, rang in my head. I asked my father why a stranger would give him a Dirham coin to buy something for me, a person whom he had never met before, who’s name he did not know… My father looked at me and said “…Because… you remind him of his son…”

I have long forgotten whether or not we actually bought a soda or not but I can clearly remember the white taxi, the pathaan driving it and that one Dirham coin he had sacrificed to make me happy… all because I looked like his son. I look around me and I notice innumerable people going on with their lives; and I notice the fathers who have left their families behind. I notice the single mothers who have left their children with their grandmas. And for that split second, I feel their pain. I feel their longing… their loneliness… their empty houses. This is especially conspicuous in a place like Dubai where there are a lot of labourers and most of them cannot afford bringing their family with them. 

This article is dedicated to all those people and, in particular, to that pathaan who made me realize the value of one Dirham.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.96,312,60,2023

Good Day.

Electronic Engineer . I have been working in Dubai for almost 5 years in Extra Low Voltage field mainly lighting and lighting controls and certified with PMP as well. Right now, looking at a job switch. Places where I have interviewed the salary on offer is average(9k). Looking at my seniors, I don’t feel much growth in the lighting field here in future. The salary and growth is flat.

I feel that the market here is very congested with limited projects and payment issues hence was looking to explore another field, was thinking of cloud computing but that's  a completely different trajectory from current experience and as a specialization would require certification and effort.

What field similar to ELV industry has good growth for the coming years. 

Also, thinking of doing a side business to supplement income. Any ideas please DM.

I have a monthly obligation of 1600 AED with my only credit card from ENBD and missed 2 months of payments due to being jobless for 7 months and running out of my emergency fund.

3331,submission,10zl84q,2023-02-11 15:26:36,"Needs suggestions on buying apartment in Skycourts TLDR Alert

Dear Fellow Dubaites,

I am thinking to buy a One BHK apartment in Skycourts Tower F (pool facing) with balcony. Area of the apartment is around 842 sq. ft. Broker has shown the apartment and ask for this apartment is 360K AED

Below are my high level calculations for this:

360K - Apartment cost
25K - additional (4% DLD + 2 brokrage and NOC++)

I've some savings here and back home which is worth 150K and remaining 235K I am thinking to take on personal loan at 6.49% reducing interest rate (3.49% flat). 

I've done some research and met real people who are living there and asked their feedback too as per them it's heaven and the price I am getting is unbelievable and I should take it with closed eyes bla bla (This guy bought a 2 bhk 8 years back at 1.2 mn which is worth 500K as on today).

I also heard about the high cooling charges there and ask a resident there about it and she gave me fundas on how can I reduce it by putting ceiling fans and even coolers 😂

Reason for choosing Skycourts 

1. I am planning to stay there with my family. I am choosing this area as my kid got admission in Indian High School Garhoud so travelling for him will be quite easy. 
2. I didn't found any 1 bhk property in Dubai which at this price (360K for 845 sq ft) with the amenities I saw there. 
3. Seeing high rental yield. 1 BHk rent currently is 36K which is almost 10% gross rental yield and 6-6.6% net yield. 
4. As per the title deed current owner bought the apartment at 455K in June 2020. (Not sure why  Skycourts prices are falling below the 2020 crash prices whereas everywhere else is rising to new highs after the 2020 crash)

Reason for choosing Personal loan over home loan.

1. Longer process, many different charges, floating interest rates. Whereas on personal loan I need pay only 1% processing fee other than the interest. 

I really need genuine feedback or advise from on ground people here (Not brokers please) whether Skycourts is a good Community and moreover good investment option to stay with family. 

If not for buying, will you recommend to stay at Skycourts on rental basis. 

If you've come this far than Thank you so much and please make little more efforts to provide your valuable advice also.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.78,6,29,2023

Hello everybody,

I am a medical graduate from a university here and I am currently doing my internship at DHA. I am planning to apply to the medical residency programs in all of the Emirates and hopefully will get into one by the end of this year, however, with the way things are, locals given preference (and we have MANY local graduates), wasta and all that biz, it's quite hard for an expat with no connections to get into the specialty of their choice. I am doing all I can, giving the residency entrance exam, doing other work to be able to make an impressive CV, but it is what it is, you just have to be really lucky to get in. So, I basically wanna explore employment options besides specialty training for a medical graduate. I could just stay home for a year, do clinical attachments and all that stuff, but honestly, I am 25 now and I just feel like I need to start earning. It's got nothing to do with my family, they always support my plans, so if I wanna take a break for a year, they will support me, but I just feel like I need to have my own income now. I live quite a comfortable life, but I basically just want to do it by myself, if you get what I mean. I get these thoughts that I am living off my parents and feel worthless sometimes, although they have never thought so that way. I have never worked a job before cuz you know how Asian parents are, when you are in university, you just gotta study and that's all. Anyway, so I want some ideas for what options may be available to someone like me. I have read stuff on the internet but a lot of what I found requires experience and I have none. Even part-time will do. Anything to keep me busy and earn some money. If anybody here is working in healthcare and knows any clinical job options, please mention them.

Anyone know how to dispute a speeding fine in Dubai? I got 2 fines last week. I have been taking the same route (this was on Oud Metha road) almost every week and drive at the same speed. I got a fine for 600 and another for 700. While it is possible that i might have gone above the speed limit when going to Oud Metha Rd from Al Ain where the speed reduces, its impossible for me to go more than 30 kmph on the way back when the speed limit increases from 60 - 80 - 100. The radar does have my plate number but I am unsure if the radar was faulty or if it captured me incorrectly instead of another car (if at all it is possible). I just thought it might just be worth it to file a dispute if I can.

I just need a place to put some servers with good internet WITHOUT paying more for half a rack of equipment than I do for my apartment (which is quite large). Either I get no call back from any provider, or the prices I get quoted are INSANE. And for those insane prices, they have the audacity to tell me they are higher than in Europe because electricity is more expensive here - while the DEWA list shows me that it is a LOT cheaper than in most of Europe and they mark the price up by a FACTOR of 15. And let's not get into the pricing for internet, which seems to be on just installing a separate business line ONLY for my rack - at least that is where the price puts it.

It is so insane I am seriously considering opening a hosting centre myself. Was in the ISP business many years ago, in Europe it is now a game for the big players as it is super-efficient, but here - just having a sales team that answers the call seems to be unusual. Easy to beat that.

I am looking or 1/3rd or 1/2 of a rack, peak power consumption about maybe 4kw to 5kw, but hardly ever reached. Just the not so usual home lab. Just as a note- I was quoted what amounts to about 10.000 AED per month for this configuration with a decent internet speed. In a data centre.

Today I went to drop my brother at DXB Departures and since he is quite young I went a few meters with him to show the entry gates. Meanwhile the airport security police person came to my car and asked for my driving license. I know I was gonna get fined, so I told him that I was literally here. But he insisted so I gave him the license. A fine was issued immediately for 500dhs. 

I am quite shocked by this incident because it happened so quickly and there were other cars which were parked before me and left after me but the policeman never went to them. 

Although I am okay to pay fines for violations (this was my first one in the UAE in 2 years) but this felt a little erratic. So I am just trying to understand what went wrong here?

1. Am I not allowed to leave my driver seat when dropping someone at the airport?
2. What is the time limit inside which you need to finish dropping off someone? Is there a time limit at all or is it completely subjective?


I looked up other options, and found out that I could go to the parking lot instead and avoid getting fined next time, but then I fail to understand what the departure drop off point is supposed to serve?

Hi everyone 👋🏽 I’m a new first time mom planning to visit my family in Dubai soon. My son is 3 months old right now and was born premature due to which he has GERD - a reflux disorder. He is currently on a special infant formula - an Amino Acid based formula meant for Cows Milk Protein Allergy and gastro conditions and also a compounded medication called Omeprazole. I am looking for alternatives in Dubai so that I can travel with my son. Are there any parents here who have experience with their babies having GERD? What formula did you use?

So my friend has set up a company with a well known 'zone' here, and now on renewal, they are trying to charge him over 25,0000 AED! Is this the way with these setup places? He said it was super easy to setup and cheap, and now he knows why, they get the money in year2.

So would writing a bad google review make a difference to get them to drop the price? Can he do that legally with slander laws etc?

What is his comeback? They inserted a sneaky clause into the contract too, 120 days bfore has to tell them AND pay 7000 something to leave them. 

Has anyone had a similar experience and gotten out without paying?

In the police application the image does not appear and in the complaint I asked for the photograph but they did not send it to me.

If I didn't go research I wouldn't know any of this, other than the 1000AED fine.

I honestly don't think I am even average in it myself but my clients, employers, collegues all say I am one of the best minds in software development they have worked with. My last employer, I worked for him for 2 years and wished to continue but all of a sudden he would low key threaten me to transfer all my skills to couple of his relatives. I learned and honed my skills literally by getting my hair and beard white. Not exaggerating but I am 30 however, 95% of my beard is white, 70% of my chest is white colored hair and 60% of my head hair all this busting my ass working 18 hours a day 6 days a week in my early days.

So when I was asked to 'transfer knowledge' also without any incentive I resigned and never looked back.

Got a new job better pay with current employer. Where I am the sole developer. 2 years are completed and now there's this talk of training a junior guy who will take the burden away from me shit. I don't mind if someone trained comes and join my team but I am anal about teaching someone my skills to someone and there's a big chance I will leave my current employer too. What's with same pattern and why with me?

I low key told my current employer that the junior can take classes do small projects prove himself and here and there if he gets stuck I can assist like how managers do but to build. Someone from ground up is so wrong to me and of course once the guy is up to my level all of a sudden the employer doesn't need me I know the future too of this game.

**This post is directed to those who are working within the logistics and travel sectors in the UAE.** I have been given the task to research commercial vans which will be used in the company I am working in. The company mainly deals in dry food items like (rice/sugar/oils and FMCG), currently, we have a Toyota Hiace (2014) and looking to extend our fleet.   


The Hiace is a good van but the official payload capacity is 1-1.5 tonnes sometimes we do load up to 2 tonnes but recently we have had to hire vehicles from outside to carry out deliveries due to the limited capacity of our current van plus we have faced situations where the van would break down given its age. 

We are a small company and the budget is up to AED125K. Our top priority is payload capacity, reliability, maintenance costs, fuel efficiency, and safety. I am quite keen on Peugeot Boxer since it's longer/wider and higher than the Hiace plus a good payload capacity of up to 3 tonnes. But I am not sure if it is a reliable van that wouldn't end up giving us high maintenance costs.

I recently rented an apartment in Dubai and attempted to register the Ejari, but was informed by the office that I cannot do so as the landlord has outstanding debts. I have been patiently waiting for the landlord to settle the debts for 10 days now, but it seems he is not willing to do so.

As of now, we are using his DEWA account. However, today he threatened to disconnect the service as he is insisting on receiving the first rent payment in cash, despite my payment being made by cheque, and he agreed to that when he signed the contract.

I have already filed a petition order at RDC, but I am wondering if there are any other actions I can take to hold him accountable for his disrespectful behavior.

If a foreign bank were to collapse, what would happen to our business banking? Is investing in real estate in Dubai a safer option than keeping our money in foreign banks operating in the UAE? 

My opinion is real estate is much safer so it is good time to invest now in Dubai real estate market instead of keeping the money sitting in foreign banks operating in the UAE. I've heard that even if the real estate market goes down, you won't lose too much it could always go back up and I see it always just goes up.

Due to the recent changes in the law, allowing foreign ownership, we're evaluating options of moving away from the local corporate nominee structure.

From the reintroduction of airport-to-airport requirements, the gutting of the 3-month visa in favor of 2 months, the arbitrary closure of the airport to airport flights, the introduction of the outpass fee which means that even if you have overstayed a period of 1 day, you are guaranteed to have fines in the hundreds of Dirhams, the introduction of a 1000 dhs deposit requirement for specific nationalities, it is becoming fiscally unsustainable for most people to follow the rules.

Some Emirates have even stopped issuing employment or tourist visas for some specific and cherry-picked nationalities making it impossible for companies to employ them. I have heard of people being denied visas after working in the country for over 8 years. 

Now the government claims it's introducing all these new rules & penalties because people are overstaying their visas but can't they see that their policies are the ones making it worse?

3440,submission,11spv9c,2023-03-16 14:10:36,"Question regarding exiting while on Tourist Visa Posting here because I'm sure the mods of the other sub will remove this immediately.

My grandmother is here on a 60-day tourist visa (issued by GDRFA). I applied for it via Musafir and then got it extended by another 30 days. She entered Dubai on 29/01/2023 but now needs to fly back from Sharjah.

I've checked the Visa Status on GDRFA's website and it says ""ENTRY PERMIT HOLDER IS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN UAE TILL 08-05-2023"".

As per my calculations, I think 28/04/2023 is her 90th day. Musafir says that she can exit Dubai without paying any fines till 08/05/2023, but if she wants to fly back from any other Emirate that didn't issue the visa (Sharjah in this case) then it's better to leave within the 90 day period to avoid issues. They say that sometimes Sharjah creates problems and their systems are not linked to Dubai.

Can anyone help me out here? Do you think she can exit from Sharjah on 29/04/2023 without paying any fines?",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,1.0,1,1,2023

3447,submission,11tqdxm,2023-03-17 16:58:25,"Dubai rental laws require update Unpopular opinion - The rental market has become very volatile with LLs trying to increase rent, serving eviction notice, RDC inundated with cases etc.  The current law require a revisit by authorities - why? 

1. Until 2010, 95% of Dubai rental properties were primarily owned by a GCC national / family firm and Govt related firms. Most were built on their own capital and rents were very volatile, with the tenants almost always being on the receiving end.  There even used to be the concept of 'key money' charged by old tenantsof low cost flats (like the Karama Rashid Colony) just to vacate, from new tenants. The new Dubai Law was introduced and later amended, which helped manage the volatility
2. Since 2010, with more Freehold properties hitting the market, more and more LLs started taking Mortgages for Buy to Let.  I should guess that by now, 2023, more than 50% of available Units are now Expat owned, typical middle class sorts, with Mortgages 
3. Two major events have rocked the boat for LLs. 1. Covid - All rents contacted by 30-40% overnight and LLs had no choice but to rent out to keep the cash flow at least partially, to pay Mortgages. 2. Interest rates have gone up from 2% to 6% last 12 months, increasing monthly mortgage payments or tenor significantly 

In this context, the Laws are now difficult for LL. When rents go down, tenants are at liberty to serve 2 month notice and move out. When rents go up, LLs can barely increase, and the 12 month notice of eviction, subsequent legal headaches etc are difficult for single property LLs to manage. 

If the laws are not updated, I see a long term trend of:

1. Buy to Let market with single property LLs dying a slow death, resulting again in 2010 and before situation of monopolies. Bad to renters in long term 
2. Buy to Let LLs preferring to let out properties on short term rentals like AirBNB - not good for communities in the long term 
3. Buy to Let LLs not letting their property even if vacant, for a period of time, waiting for higher rents. Not good for society and economy as a whole.

Some suggestions:

1. 12 month eviction should be without any strings attached
2. Scrap the RERA index as it is outdated and completely ignore specific building or modifed Units and hence higher value
3. Encourage long term leases - 3 year lease at say, max 5 % increase or decrease, between LLs and Tenants",1,"['dubai', 'uae', 'arabic', 'people', 'sharjah', 'country', 'abu', 'dhabi', 'emirates', 'like']",uae_cities_region,0.57,3,20,2023

I got a lot of support from the community and many people have followed up since.

It went through the Court of First Instance and then the Appeals Court. Karen's family didn't take it further.

In the First Instance court, she lost and was sentenced to 3 months in prison, but the sentence was commuted because she is a mother. She was also fined AED 200k. She appealed the decision on some nonsense points. A few months after that, she lost the Appeals court case, which decision came out last month. She had a month to appeal again, but chose not to.

She wired me the money a few days ago and is officially a convicted person in the UAE, which is something that she will carry with her, forever. If she gets another criminal sentence of any kind, she will be deported.

After legal fees and such, not much of that 200k is left. But I gave half of what is left to the security guard.

After all these months and many court hearings, it's finally *over*. Thanks for all your support guys, it was a very long fight, but I'm glad I fought it.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.98,1544,340,2023

3567,submission,12rwnsr,2023-04-19 19:13:15,"Good Bye Dubai/UAE 👋 After 38 wonderful years in this city, it's time for me to bid adieu (at least for now). As a long-time UAE resident who grew up in Dubai, this place holds a special place in my heart. It's where my parents came (on a ship) to seek a better life in the mid-70s, and where my brother and I grew up.

I remember the struggles my parents faced in the early days, but they worked tirelessly to provide for us. We went from surviving on my dad's multiple low-paying part-time jobs and the neighborhood grocery's monthly credit to having a comfortable life. Looking back, I realize this beautiful country gave us a life we may not have had back home.

Now, as I sit at the airport (where my 38 years of life has been condensed into 3 trolley bags) waiting to catch my flight to a new destination, I can't help but feel emotional. Dubai has been my home for as long as I can remember. But, I'm excited about the next phase of my life - the thrill of starting anew and learning something new.

I'll miss my friends, the convenience this place offers, and the discussions about karak and Onam chips in this sub. But, I'll always cherish the memories and the life lessons that this city has taught me. 

Lastly, I want to say a big thank you to all of you for the great discussions and helpful answers to my queries. But above all, I am grateful to r/Dubai for introducing me to a sweet internet stranger who is now my inseparable soul...all this happened at a time when I had lost all hope in finding love. 

Until we meet again,
A Dubai lover.

Tdlr- An overly emotional adult sharing some thoughts before leaving Dubai.

Edit: thank you everyone for the good wishes. 🙏 This is why this sub is dear to me. Yea we have the occasional insensitive comments and fights.. but overall, we have had some good times. I msged one of the mods if it was ok for me to kinda work out a way to pre-pay for some karak tea at a local tea brand, so that I can offer all of you free karak on my behalf before I left. But I guess the mod hasn't seen my msg or it's against the sub rules.. that's ok .

Can I hire a bike there? Recommended place?
I’ll take a taxi tomorrow, what’s the precise location?
Any places for a break / eats along the route? Or do I need to prepare beforehand?

**Sharings summary:
Thank you all for your comments for an awesome ride yesterday:

* Started cycling at 5:30am - the air was gorgeous

Hiring a bike
* Hired a hybrid bike (all they had left) from the nearest place the taxi dropped me off: Last Exit Al Qudra
* Didn’t book online because I had no idea what I’d need and for how long. Not sure if there are penalties for bringing it back late
* Staff at the shop were super friendly and helpful, and the rates seemed cheaper than online
* Best to book in advance in the weekends and other busy days. They only had a few bikes left at 5:15am
* Bring ID to rent the bike (I didn’t, so left my hotel key card with the deposit)

The ride
* The wind picked up at 9 or 10, so recommend a road bike to reduce wind resistance 
* Early start (cycling before 6:30am) essential as it gets hot quickly after 8
* The roads are silky smooth asphalt with no traffic or traffic lights for 84k!
* A variety of routes from a flat, traffic light-free, smooth 45k to 150k with some gentle undulating terrain. If that’s too far, cycle until you’re almost tired, and double back
* Need to prepare all your water, you’ll need more than you expect
* Shelters every 10k about
* Going counter-clockwise, the large trees at 5km mark are a wonderful and cool rest area after your ride to soak up the sounds and feel of the desert
* Prepared dried fruit, nuts and energy bars
* Sun cream, and green after sun
* People are very friendly and helpful and will stop to check you’re fine and offer assistance 
* Off road cycling options available to get even further away - must have wide tyres due to the sand
* 4x4 safari drivers are super polite and patient. When they’re “near” to a bike, they drive super slow and give the cycling plenty of space. Something drivers in other countries should learn

* Careem: there are a few, but the battery won’t last for a nice ride. Cycling a Careem without battery power is an extreme workout. I know. Been there, done that. Emptied the batteries of 3 Careems gently cycling around Jumeirah beach

* Night: you’ll need lights!!!

The air was gorgeous, animals, birds, desert. Really fantastic - thank you guys for the valuable suggestions to make such a beautiful ride",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,1.0,10,11,2023

I’ve been living in Dubai for almost 6 months now and I really don’t understand why people make it out to have great food. Sure there are some fancy restaurants (most of which are not from here) which open branches in Dubai, but most restaurants are not great. Especially for delivery. And the supermarkets here also have extremely poor standards. 

I am from the U.K. and so I’m used to being able to buy something in a supermarket and it being safe to eat and tasting great. Here however, you need to check which country it’s come from. If the best before date is correct (and not that someone has just stuck a new date on). Even after all of that the food is still hit and miss and on the whole, not very good.

Anyone else feel the same way?

Edit: the comments are a mix of different opinions but I think I may have made the wrong impression on some people. I was not trying to say that the food everywhere in Dubai is dreadful.

So my car (Ford Mustang) was in an accident and was sent to a garage for repair by the insurance provide. First of all, they took around 45 days to repair what was called a minor physical damage by the insurance inspector.I was pretty patient as it was Ramadan and didn't take cash from the insurance provider for repairs as they were only offering AED 7k which was way less.Anyways, I finally got my car after a month and a half and I had to drop it off to the wrapping shop the same night (most garages work at night during ramadan). The car was driving fine except the alignment was off and the garage said that they cant do anything or it as it was not in the police report. I let it go as it was just 50-100 aed job.

However, when i reached the wrapping shop, we noticed smoke coming out of the hood and immediately parked the car in a an empty area. After some inspection we found out that there was a piece of cloth under the engine which was on fire and we somehow managed to take it out. I've no idea what damage it did or might have cause in my car. What if I'd driven for 20 more minutes and blew up my car on the way.

I called the garage, sent them a video and got a meek apology. How should I approach this situation?Should I aim for a compensation? Whom do I connect with and what might be the outcome?

My life has been continously improving since the day I moved to Dubai while still in school, I know that, and I know I have many blessings that others don't. 

Growing up and going to school my dad always pushed me to do well academically, and to be the top of the class, and this was a way to measure success I guess. I managed to do that, and in college I was top of my department. I also got my first job relatively easily.

Fast forward 15 years, I'm making 55k a month, my wife almost 12k as a freelancer, she can do much better if she started a career but she wants the flexibility. We own our own townhouse, which is almost fully paid now and I am really happy with. We fly to the UK every summer because that's where my wife's family lives, and we often go to the US with my parents when we can. The kids have both sets of passports, which I know is quite lucky since we are both second generation immigrants. 

Compared to my core guy friends group I think I am doing fairly well, but when hanging out with other couples here, mostly her friends, I feel I am lagging way behind, some of them are C level at my age, bigger houses, new Range Rovers, flying business class everywhere (and I am not even considering the guy that has a Bentley and a Urus), and since we sometimes travel together increases the pressure on me to match their lifestyle because we have to book the same hotel and the same flights. Even my wife's family in the UK live quite a similar lifestyle, and at times I think I am not doing enough to provide for her. 

I don't know what I am expecting from this post, but I just felt like letting it out since it's been constantly on my mind lately. I know it's wrong to compare, but sometimes it's just a bit too difficult when it's the people you hang out with every weekend.

I listen to interviews in Dubai Eye 103.8 in the morning ( Business Breakfast) and always noticed that the interviewees with origin in Indian, Pakistani, Lebanese, Syrian, Jordan, Egypt etc faking the F out of their accents ( UK or US)

Recently there was this Mastercard senior person and she started off with solid US accent and within 3 minutes accidentally moved into Islamabad English ( which is probably  her original accent) and again shifted back to a US accent. Almost all the women I listened to faked accents.  

There was this CISCO dude, who is obviously Indian and was trying to sound all British and couldn't maintain it beyond 2 minutes. Same with Middle Eastern folks.

EU folks also try very hard to sound British and can manage only for a minute.

At least women do a better job of faking it for some time. But the guys can't last even 2 minutes with this BS.

The only cool people who are comfortable with their accents are Emiratis. They just speak in their actual accent.

My question is why is it necessary to try hard and fake an accent that these interviewees actually can't handle. What stops these fellas from talking normally ?

I know that the entire Dubai Eye 103.8 gang lurks here. So I am asking you Richard & Brandy.

This was an opportunity out of the blue, having all my roots in UAE. I have never considered migrating. 
Paying taxes in Germany seem like the biggest concern to me as of now.

Is dubai the tax free heaven worth dropping the offer from Germany?

This is the message for those who cares about the nature. Please reply/comment your opinion under this post.

[Al Qudra lakes](https://www.oasispalmdubai.com/blog/city-sightseeing/al-qudra-lake/) is unique nature environment attracting thousands of birds of different species. Majority of them makes Al Qudra [their home](https://gulfnews.com/uae/al-qudra-lakes-the-new-haven-for-exotic-birds-1.1986494). Some of these birds, especially smaller ones - are extremely curious and don't know that they need to keep away from fast moving cars.

And they are being hit by cars unfortunately - not massively, but it happens.

Please drive carefully in Al Qudra surrounding roads (5-7 km radius). That will let you keep nature safe.

One of the potential root causes of the problem is the fact that speed limit on some of the roads around lakes area ranges from 80 to 100 kmph. Which may be too high to let tiny curios birds to escape approaching car.

As a solution, which may be unpopular, I propose reviewing speed limits around Al Qudra Lakes to 60kmph. The lower speed limits will affect only roads in the radius of 5-7 km around lakes and will have minimal impact on commute time.

Need your opinion, votes and voices on this topic, after that we can submit an idea/proposal to Dubai Road Authorities.

Thank you

3621,submission,133j7f4,2023-04-30 12:00:09,"Where's Dubai headed economy-wise? Monaco model? or Singapore model? Allow me to explain. Both these economies grew through strategies similar to the one that Dubai is now starting to follow. Providing a safe haven for the rich to park their assets. 

The difference is the following:
Monaco is a playground for the super rich and stops at that. 
Singapore parks a lot of global assets in a relatively risk free political environment and a robust banking infrastructure (better than Switzerland, id argue). 

But Singapore is an economy built on Middle class success. Their HDB (government subsidised housing) policy is the cornerstone of middle class enablement. 

Monaco, on the other hand, isn't a real economy and lacks a middle class. Nothing wrong with that. Just saying it as it is.

Now, Dubai is unique. One could argue that it's increasingly a parking space for global assets and second residence with the new opening up of the economy.  While Dubai had a middle class, they are increasingly getting priced out. 

What's unique about Dubai is the proximity to Sharjah. If asset prices and inflation remain unchecked, Dubai will increasingly be attractive to high net worth and high income people who can still retain a lot of earnings because of zero or low tax. Lower middle class folks will gradually be pushed out to 'satellite Town' Sharjah. But the middling middle class will not find a place in Dubai and will not find the Sharjah trade-off worth it (getting stuck in traffic daily to hit jobs in dubai).

So where do you think it's headed. Dubai can succeed with both models. The question is whether the middle class folks (e.g. those earning between 100K to 300K AED per annum) will find a place here if the Monaco model plays out.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.97,357,112,2023

I earn a very good living, over 25k a month, and I've indulged in all the trappings that this city has to offer. I've frequented some of the most exclusive clubs and pubs, gone on lavish safaris, dined at the most expensive restaurants, and lived in some of the most luxurious buildings.

I've also splurged on some of the most extravagant cars, clothes, shoes, and watches, not to mention the loans and credit cards that I've used to finance my lavish lifestyle. Despite all of this, I can't say that I regret any of it. For me, it's all about living life to the fullest and enjoying the fruits of my hard-earned labour.

I have a question, asking for a friend.

Let say they accepted an job offer letter (and signed it) and even the contract was already signed by both parties (employer and my friend). Now, my friend changes their mind and decides to not go ahead with that company.

Just to clarify, the Visa is not under process yet because the previous employer has not cancelled it yet.

Also, the contract with the new company states the following:

“This Agreement shall enter in force and be valid for an unlimited period of time as of the day the Employee has effectively started her/his Duties with the Employer”.

Does this mean that the contract is not binding until the employee starts working with the company, and can be cancelled without repercussions?

Is there any website or place where this can be checked?

I've lived in a bunch of places. Almost ten different countries, if you can believe it. But it's only here in Dubai that I'm not scared to leave my car or apartment open. US/EU? Forget about it. That says something.

The Emiratis are so welcoming and friendly. I mean, I've had so many cups of Arabic coffee or karak and shared so many meals with locals here, it's crazy. They're so hospitable to me, it's like they want to make you feel at home.

There's no tax. Zero. And I can run my company just the way I want. I can make decisions, I make money, and not worry about the government telling me what to do and taking 60% of the revenue. I've built a successful business here. I honestly don't think I could have done the same in Western Europe.

Is the place expensive? Sure, but you don't have to spend your money on luxury options, if you don't want to. It's your choice.

No place is perfect. Every country has its good and bad sides. But we need to remember the good stuff too. I think I would go further and say that we should focus on the good stuff. We need to be EXTREMELY thankful for the freedom and safety we have here.

I've recently been exploring various business opportunities and came across an organization called the Dubai Business Associates. From what I understand, they offer a unique program which combines business experience with cultural learning in one of the world's most dynamic business environments.

However, before I venture further, I thought I'd reach out to the Reddit community to gain a more rounded perspective.

For those who aren't aware, the Dubai Business Associates program is a 10-month, not-for-profit initiative which is sponsored by leading companies in Dubai. It aims to provide fresh graduates or early career individuals from all around the globe with an understanding of the business landscape in Dubai and the wider Middle East region.

But, I have a few questions I'm hoping someone with first-hand experience or knowledge can answer:

1. **What makes the Dubai Business Associates program so good?** From your perspective, what sets this program apart from other similar opportunities?
2. **What are the prospects after completing the program?** Do participants typically find lucrative opportunities in Dubai or elsewhere? Or do they return to their home countries with enhanced skills and knowledge?
3. **What's the work-life balance like?** Dubai is known for its hustle and bustle. Is the program intense, or is there a fair balance between work and cultural experiences?
4. **Does it provide a global networking platform?** How influential are the connections you make during this program?
5. **Is there anything you wish you had known before joining the program?** Any insights that might be helpful for someone considering this opportunity?

Thank you in advance for taking the time to answer my queries. I really appreciate your input as it will help me make a more informed decision.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.75,2,1,2023

The Abu Dhabi Police have launched a new road alert system across highways in the UAE Capital. The radar-like devices have been installed along the highways to alert drivers of traffic incidents or weather conditions. The aim is to enhance road safety, the police said.
Different colours flash on the system to alert drivers of traffic incidents or weather conditions.

The flash alerts are powered by solar energy and batteries. They are visible from a distance of up to 200 metres during the day and night.

She was obviously terrified and left the place immediately, and will probably avoid that place for the foreseeable future. However, it is sad to witness such incidents occurring in Dubai, where people were previously fearful of catcalling women due to the substantial penalties in place. Unfortunately, the lack of extensive police patrols in these areas, particularly on foot, makes it challenging to enforce these penalties.

So this happened back in 2018. I had resigned from my post as an office manager and was searching for a job in the field of Mall operations that I was really interested in doing. I finally and after months of tirelessly searching and applying, got my desired role as a duty manager in one of the malls in Dubai. 

I was the first and the only female duty manager to join a team of 8 other managers that all worked under the Mall operations department, reporting to Director of Operations. At first, I had no idea that i was the only person who got selected into the role based on my qualifications and experiences. The rest of the guys on the team had become managers through promotions from much junior roles in the company and were promoted into the role. I came to find out later that they weren't on the same level of academic qualifications as me. 

Somehow they had found out that i was getting paid a bit higher than some of the duty managers on the team and as close as what the seniors were getting paid. However, I only found out this fact later after my resignation. 

now into the details of the bullying: 

the first 2 weeks of working there were kind of normal, there was a bit of uneasy feeling when i had to sit with the team and learn from them since they were all men and i was the only female but i didn't think much of it. I thought by time we will get to know each other better and will be able to build a colleague to colleague connection and understanding just like any other job. 

but I noticed they kind of always distanced themselves from me. They would sit in a different room, they wouldn't even try to get to know me, they weren't friendly at all,  They wouldn't include me in day to day operations discussions on updates what was coming up in the mall etc. 

I have to point that they were a mixed of Indian and Arab nationalities and often time they would talk in a different language and i wouldn't understand. 

About two months into the role, i started fully understanding my JD and took over major responsibilities and started bringing some changes into the department. I really enjoyed what i was doing However noticed that i wasn't welcomed in the team yet. 

Apart from my team though, People in other departments were really nice and friendly. They would cheer me on, invite me to go on lunch with them and even ask me how i was progressing which my team mates never did. I wondered what was wrong. Was it the fact that i was a female? 

I don't know where i went wrong or what wrong i did but i slowly started noticing a pattern of behavior by my team. I noticed that they would always put me on unusual shifts. graveyard shift.I had to be all alone and do patrolling of an entire mall and parking areas at night after mall closing hours. 

I didn't complain about it trusting and respecting my seniors decision but my sleeping & resting patterns were getting affected. 

I noticed my team on the day shift would not properly handover to me or keep me in the loop of what happened in their shift so i can carry on the task on my shift. when i asked them they would tell me to check the email. there weren't any emails most of time. 

Then i noticed my lunch and my uniform was going missing from the office which only our team had access to it. one time I put my lunch box in the fridge and left the office for patrolling in the mall when i came back, i saw my lunch box in the garbage and there were no cctv in the office to check who did it. I asked the present duty manager and he said he didn't know with a smirk. 

One time, i found human feces on my uniform in the changing room and we weren't allowed to roam around at work without a uniform so i had to wear the one from day before which wasn't clean. 

We had a 12 hours shift and i noticed whenever i was on the shift no one would take the handover from me until i would reach 15-16 hours. i couldn't clock out before handing over to the next shift cause i couldn't find my colleagues anywhere. When i called them to come and take over the shift they would respond with something like ""oh you already tired ? we did 20 hours straight when we just joined"".

I noticed whenever i wanted to go on my one hour break, they would make me feel so guilty about it. they were commenting on me that managers don't take break! i found it odd and stupid but chose to not respond and just walk away. 

In summer they would put my shift outside the mall or in the parking area. you already know how hot it gets in Dubai and mall parkings are suffocating. 

it then escalated to whenever there was an issue or a mistake i was to be blamed out of no where. They would give me wrong or incomplete information and then pretend that i was the one who forgot it. Even if i was silent with all the other stuff i defended myself when it came down to my performance on my tasks cause i knew i did my best at it. 

I started losing weight and was terrified to go to work every day. I couldn't believe that i was going through this disrespect and hate. I didn't even recognize that this was bullying until one time I broke down when I came back to my room from my long shift so my roommate asked me of what happened and she told me that this was bullying. 

The next day i went to office and confronted them with everything i was feeling and their collective response to it was that I was a female and not suitable for that kind of role in the first place. but i knew i was doing my job as per the training and as per what they thought me to do. We had a heated argument and I knew it was time to bring this to my boss. 

I told my boss but sadly i didn't get the response that I was expecting. He kind of told me that if everyone else is giving him a feedback that I wasn't right for the job then maybe I wasn't right for the job without further investigation in the matter. 

that was the time I realized this was not worth my mental health and my energy so I decided to handover my resignation, only after eight months of working in that company. 

Now I am working in another company which is into real estate and I am in a much more better environment than the previous job. I am also working here as a manager and I really like the office environment, my colleagues and the company I work at. I am happy and well respected. But that experience will always be a part of my journey.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.91,108,58,2023

3758,submission,13mi8bu,2023-05-20 08:48:21,"UAE announces new traffic violations, fines of up to Dh2,000 
New traffic fines of up to Dh2,000 have been announced in the UAE. The Ministry of Interior posted on Twitter that the “new additions” aim to boost safety, especially during emergencies related to rainy and unstable weather conditions.

The new fines are:

>> Gathering near valleys, flooded areas and dams during rainy weather: Dh1,000 fine and six black points.

>> Entering flooded valleys, regardless of their level of danger: Dh2,000 fine, 23 black points, and 60-day confiscation of vehicles.

>> Obstructing the relevant authorities from regulating traffic; or ambulance and rescue vehicles during emergencies, disasters, crises and rains; and in flooded valleys: Dh1,000 fine, four black points, and 60-day confiscation of vehicles.

When rains hit the country, it’s common among residents to go to mountainous areas to enjoy the pleasant weather. However, several warnings have been issued in the past to highlight how floodwaters can quickly swamp low-lying areas.

Generally, authorities in the UAE issue alerts for residents to stay away from valleys and dams during unstable weather conditions. Heavy rains usually result in valleys flooding quickly as water gushes down the mountains.

Motorists are also always warned to avoid crossing valleys during rains due to the risk of vehicles drifting. With these new laws and fines, it’s now illegal for residents and tourists to venture out to areas prone to floods during rainy weather.

There have been many instances of people getting stranded during a downpour. Multiple emergency response teams had to work around the clock to rescue hundreds of people when rains battered the country’s east last year.

The amendments to the traffic law aim to “reinforce existing procedures and underline the significance of adhering to instructions and safety requirements”, the ministry added.

According to Brig-Gen Engineer Hussein Al Harthi, chairman of the Federal Traffic Council, it is prohibited to enter valleys during rains, “despite the danger level”.

“These amendments are introduced alongside other significant and fundamental articles in the law, which urge road users — including drivers and pedestrians — to exercise utmost care and caution (during unstable weather). Motorists must not endanger their lives or those of others. They must abide by traffic regulations, signs, and signals, comply with instructions from police officers, stay in their designated lanes, and follow the guidance of police, traffic, civil defence, emergency, disaster, and crisis management personnel in emergency situations. Road users are also expected to avoid causing … harm, hindrance, or disturbance to others,” the official added.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.89,14,4,2023

We were waiting for an elevator along with a middle eastern couple (they were wearing traditional clothing). The husband had a kid in a stroller and his wife was pregnant so we let them enter the elevator first. When we proceeded to also get in, the wife said something in Arabic and the husband seemed displeased with our presence. I walked past his wife with enough distance between us and stood next to my mother. Out of nowhere, I felt a hand grab my shirt's sleeve. The husband, without saying anything, pulled me to his side rather aggressively. He was just staring at me while doing this and I was like what are you doing?! My aunt who works here in Dubai told me that he probably didn't like me standing near his wife. We didn't overload the elevator and there was enough space between all of us. 

Did I do something wrong that I'm unaware of? I'm pretty sure I didn't but wanted to get your thoughts anyways so that I can be mindful.

Last night heading towards Jumeriah on financial Center rd, I indicated to change lanes, I changed lanes and Nissan Patrol behind me started flashing me non stop and beeping. Went chaotic, came parallel to me squeezing past other traffic, rolled window down and started yelling at me to pull over. My wife went in full distress mode, lights went green, these two locals are yelling and screaming and beeping. 
I remained calm and kept driving to find a any shopping Center carpark. Drove for 5 more minutes, they kept tailing us and beeping and flashing (can’t judge or make the the claim but looked drunk). 
I found city walk outdoor parking, and calmly parked. Wife asked me to lock doors and stay inside. I was getting a bit hot headed, so was ready to get out the car, the patrol blocked our car and both guys actual jumped out the their cars. 
Immediately start yelling to hand over my emirates ID and claiming to be the police. I lost patience and got out the car, suddenly they take step back (I am 6’2”) and they were much shorter than me. 
One guy says “wallahi I am the police give me your emirates ID, you didn’t pull over when I asked”. 
I say back to him “ no problem please call the police and do not come near me” 
His other mate jumps in and says “ no we are the police I am CID you give me 800 aed right now” 
I told him “please call the police”. 
Then they knew I wasn’t buying their bluff and they walked off. 
It was just me wife and I, trying to go for a simple dinner and have some time together (we have been having some other health issues we are trying to deal with). These two local emaratis not only ruined our whole night, they gave my wife a panic attack and try to belittled me in front of her. 
You two, Allah is the wisest of judges, all your wealth is not your hardwork, you were just born privileged. 

TL:DR - chased and harassed by two locals in Patrol, blocked our car, claimed  to be police and then asked for 800 aed. Caused my wife to go into a panic attack. Ruined our weekend.

Update 1: hello, some people extremely butt hurt at my post, down voting and DMing me personal abuse, one went as far as to say “we are the superior race”.

Hi you guys. 

I don’t know where to start.

I (24 F) was planning on getting married last year but it did not go through literally two days before nikkah because I found out that the guy was already involved with a girl for a few years and he said yes to marrying me because of family pressure. Six months down the road, as hard as it sounds, I wish I hadn’t said no and I would’ve married him so I had some support. 

I lost my dad last month because he had an accident so he required a lot of medical care which brought me to a 21k debt. I am trying to pack back these people but I don’t know how long it will take because I’m making 2.5k a month. Being the sole provider for my mum and myself, I don’t have much left after rent, electricity, transportation and bare minimum groceries. I cannot get another job now because I took a salary advance from my company converted into three months installment so I can only start something else once this debt is over. I feel hopeless and exhausted. My mother is in a weakened state after my father’s loss so I have to cook and clean after work so I barely have a second to myself. I give tuition to few kids on the weekend when I can. I’m really struggling to cope here and I feel like I’m rotting away. With Eid coming next month, I know I won’t be able to do anything for my mum but I at least want it to not be the worst either. I hate doing this and I wish I could explain how bad I feel doing this but is there anyone here who can help me? With anything really, it doesn’t have to be monetary even if it’s just a voucher or gift card that I can use to take my mum to the shop and ask what she wants. I really don’t know what I’m asking for but at this point I don’t know what else to do.

3775,submission,13p2r54,2023-05-23 00:46:14,"Update: American woman charged with videoing and slapped with travel ban Hi all, 

I am a young muslim American woman.  A while back I posted about being harassed at the bus station. It was first in Muweilah. 

Long story short: I scanned my bus card but then the bus driver told me to go out. I went out for 2 minutes to wait. I went back on the bus again when other people started going on as well. Obviously I didn’t re-scan as I had already paid. This is a small, low traffic bus station and there were just like ~5 or so other people getting on. The bus driver was watching everything. When I got on the bus, he started chasing me down though. He also brought the manager. The two were both of Egyptian origin and did not speak English well. I held out my bus card to the manager so he can verify my payment. He did not take it and just stayed near my seat to stare. Both men knew I paid. My gut feeling was that they wanted some excitement or an excuse to interact with me because this unfortunately happens to me often. 

The driver and the manager were both surrounding my seat while I was seated and vulnerable. The driver kept repeatedly and violently shaking his hand centimeters away from my face and chest area. Since both men did not want to walk off and they couldn’t use payment as an excuse anymore, the manager then asked me why I asked a man to clear the entry door which he was blocking for 30 seconds without saying ‘excuse me’. Brief note: I actually had. He was talking down on me as if I am a school girl and asked if I have manners while continuing to stare at me from up close. He then kept demanding my emirates ID. I obviously refused as he wasn’t law enforcement. 

At this point, the passenger who was blocking the door saw what was happening and came to my defense to plead with them to leave me alone and push them away.  I assertively told all of them surrounding my seat to go away. 

Long story short, the butthurt manager then told the same passenger to share his mobile number with him and complain to etisalat metro station when we reach. The passenger had very creepy behavior himself – one minute he would try to play the Bollywood hero to save me but when I asked ALL to leave me alone, he too became butthurt and switched up to later tell emirati RTA staff at etisalat station that I had disrespected the rta staff and had a bad attitude. No shit. Obviously I do not want random men trying to create excuses to interact with me and bother me while getting up in my face and abusing their power. 

When I reached etisalat, along came men in kanduras who also worked for RTA. At one point, the passenger smirked and told me to shutup when I told him to just “move along” himself. As I said, his behavior and focus on me was also adding fuel to fire and unnecessary. The whole thing was surreal. I knew there was nothing going on except men who initially tried to make an excuse at interaction, failed, and then were acting butthurt about it – including the very man who had thrown himself into the mix initially to defend me. 

Anyway when he said “shutup” and smirked,  I began recording for my safety and to capture audio/visual evidence especially since around 5-6 men were surrounding me. For no reason. I also recorded the bus number. One of the kandura’d guys saw and instructed him to complain about me for videoing. I asked “so in other words saying shutup to someone is all right?” The kandura guy  replied centimenters away from my face “Yes and I will also tell you to SHUTUP!” I could feel his spit on my face. 

Honestly, as I said this whole shit was so unnecessary like a bad dream. A bunch of random men were coming up in my face, one after the other, for no reason at all, abusing me, and not allowing me to go on my way. One man after the other. The only word that sums it up is butthurtness and trying to validate themselves by showing a random woman their “power”. 

Anyway, at this point the bus driver was evily laughing at the whole ruckus he created and it was just continuing with the butthurt zombies behaving in a similar manner, some yelling, another asking for my emirates ID or trying to forcibly grab the phone in my hand. People who didn’t know why they were bothering me in the first place and neither did I know why. 

I am glad I did begin recording because there is audio evidence of what was being said by me and by them and proof of no wrongdoing on my part. 

Eventually, when they finally had something on me at the very end (me videoing for my protection), they called the police and filed a case against me at Al Qusais. I also filed a harassment case against them.

This event happened on January 26. I had been on a visit visa then. Slapped with a travel ban. Phone confiscated.  It has been 6 months since. I have no update from the police except that they are working on getting CCTV footage and the recordings from my phone to share with prosecution. I have probably been to the police station a dozen times in between to get updates.

By the way, I contacted the US embassy and was ignored. I contacted again and received a generic reply with a list of lawyers. I believe someone told me that the man in charge at the US embassy is Ahmad Sharif. I was told they are not legally able to meddle right now. I am planning to make an appointment to go in person and see a high-level guy because 6 months is getting ridiculous.

I tried lawyers but they were trying to leech money off of me. The one I met told me from the get-go that I’ll have to pay a fine. What kind of lawyer are you then? It all was just too corrupt so I decided to just stay in touch with the police department’s manager instead in the hope that he may be non-corrupt. 

Anyway, if anyone is able to provide me support or advice, I’d appreciate it. Otherwise, if you have nothing nice to say, I kindly ask you to please move it along.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.44,0,24,2023

It was a promotion on instagram (50% off). As soon a clicked it, it went to a link where we could order food. It seemed authentic at that time(but I realise now there were too many red flags). Once we give our credit card details, they ask for the OTP. But the OTP that is sent to you is for registering the card for mobile wallet usage (apparently thats Google pay). This was a huge mistake. I didn't go through it properly and entered the otp. But the transaction doesnt go through. Later after an hour or so. Money is charged to an offshore account very swiftly in 4-5 transactions. Mine was to a Ukraine account. I called the bank and immediately blocked the credit card and spoke to the fraud department. They gave me a dispute form to fill up and told me that resolution would take anywhere between 90 to 120 days. Since then i have been searching all over the internet about this scam. Do people get back the money from the bank? Most people who i speak to say No. Is there any possibility.

3. go for viewing and then the broker says, I am sorry but the owner/tenant has some emergency and will show the villa later. Then he/she suggests that we go to see a property in another development 20Km away.     
4. See something for 15mins which we think works and say ok, how do we proceed? agent: Actually, this property has received an offer this morning, but if you make 50K above the asking price, the seller may take your option. but you need to put in the offer right now. Bloody hell!    
5. Me, this property is 18 years old, I would need to get a technical evaluation done before making a firm offer. Agent: NO, you cannot make a technical evaluation of this home. You have to buy it as it is.

In Tinder most of the matches are from the fake accounts which shows some number on it. While in bumble, the genuine matches are close to zero most of the time. 

There is this blind dating event in bumble on Thursdays. In this event you are supposed to be randomly matched with a person and chat with them without seeing their profile first. I tried using this and found it could not match me with anyone even in that event. This kinda at least assured me that maybe it’s the problem with the population and not my face 🥲

So I am a software engineer. I was educated here and started my career here.

2 years back I got offered to join my current employer. I took it as it paid double. I was the only guy in software department. They had none before me just a contracting consultant who would help them with their software needs or develop stuff.

I happily worked, did the best, my boss and collegues quite liked me. Now, things change, and I need advice. From my experience of life and working here, I have some assumptions, but I might also be very wrong, or being pessimistic about it so here I am to hear out from my fellow Dubai redditors.

So my current employer's parent company has couple many other companies. I was told that the parent company is happy seeing my work and wants me to contribute to other of its companies as well. Well I was happy about it, cause who doesn't wanna level up and manage many more companies. But there's a catch. I was told that from a parent company a junior guy who has a business degree and is a relative of a higher up in parent company will join me, I have to teach/train him my software engineering skills and that he will assist me in managing and contributing to the other companies I will be handed over. With a promise of end of the year a salary revision. Also I will be reporting to the parent company and not my current boss anymore even though he keeps saying no don't worry I will be in touch with you. 

Now let me share the negative things that comes to my mind. 6 months down when I have taught this guy stuff, the management could easily either not revise my salary or revise it too little to then say if you don't like it leave. Because at this point the junior guys knows some stuff. (I know very well in 6 months this guy can't do the work I can as I have 6.5 years of work experience)

I just honestly don't know if this is a positive direction for my career or is my employer or the parent company has something going on.

I live in Ajman Industrial Area... I like walking around when I am on the phone... 

As I was doing that last week, I came across a cat with his jaw weird... He seemed sick, had flies around him... Poor baby was meowing for help under a car..

Called my wife and asked her to bring some cat food and water... He wasn't able to drink or eat since his jaw appeared totally broken

Got a box, took him to our regular vet... Poor thing was super friendly... Sick as he was, he was trusting, came to us... Let me pet him...

He was running a temp, had some issues... Doc wanted him admitted... Visited him every other day and seemed like he was improving... He'd recognize us... Let us pet him... Sweetest little thing (about 4 years old as per the vet - best guess since his teeth and jaw are messed up and seemingly that's how they predict age)

The vet then told me that a car probably hit him, his jaw is crushed in 3 different places, they can't do anything... But he'll survive and live normally, just needs to be provided love and attention (and wet food) 

From day 1, I told my wife to post on socials for someone to adopt him or foster and I wasn't too concerned since I always thought, worst case, I'll adopt him... It's fine... What's 3 cats instead of 2... 

Today I found out, he's F.I.V +ve... One of my 2 rescues is a F.I.P survivor and was abandoned very early by momma cat... He's survived parvo, giardia and F.I.P in his first year and has a weak immune system.... So I really can't afford to risk his health and adopt this cat...

Vet says, in his condition, he cannot be released back onto the streets... He needs to get sm1 to take him else he won't make it... It'd be better to put him to sleep... I can't imagine doing that... The image of the little guy under the car, meowing for help, trying his best to survive... I really hope I can find a home for him... 

Apologies in advance, if you've seen this on other subreddits... Yes, I am gonna be posting this on a few subs hoping I can get a lead to save his life 

If anyone here can adopt him... Please dm me... 
If you know anyone who could help, share this with them...
If there's any organization you think would help... Dm me...
If you have any ideas, something I've not thought of... Dm me...

Once again, this is not a post asking for donations, my profile is 9 years old, you can check my history, I have never made any posts like this... You can also google my user name, I am just a guy who runs a YouTube channel - no hidden agenda here... 

Here's a link to a video the vet sent me showing his jaw - https://imgur.com/a/zTPjHLN

@mods I read the rules, I don't think I've broken any rules, if by chance I have, please don't take this down, finding a home for the little guy is super time sensitive, drop me a dm and I'll provide any info you need, make any changes you need...

Then two South Asian boys came and sat right where the girls had left their belonging. I’m a South Asian myself, only using the term South Asian as I don’t want to sound discriminatory by stating their nationalities. So those two boys sat right next to the girls’ belongings and started staring the girls, passing remarks and making gestures. The girls were visibly irritated and uncomfortable. They came back to the shore to their belongings, picked them up and moved to a different spot. As the boys were literally in their face staring from point blank. Initially they were on my left and then they moved so much that they were now on my right side (from where I was sitting on my camping chair). They settled there and started swimming again. After a little while those two boys followed the girls to this new spot. I was watching this and I had made up my mind that I will intervene if they don’t stop. The girls kept swimming for a bit but then those boys took off their clothes and started swimming really close to those girls in their undergarments. Again, visibly irritated, the girls came back to the shore and started drying themselves. I went on to ask them if they’re alright. I said that I saw those boys chasing them. They said they’re alright and thanked me for checking up on them.

Meanwhile the boys didn’t stop. Their hooting increased. They kept passing by the girls and making gestures. I picked up my chair and asked the girls if I can sit behind them to which they gladly agreed. I could tell that they didn’t speak great English. They were finding it difficult to communicate. Then the boys came really close to the sitting girls and I could see their crotches in front of the girls’ faces. The girls were trying to tell them to give them some space. I intervened and asked those boys to leave and give them some space. I even tried calling the security guard for help. But thankfully, credit to those boys they listened to me and left the girls alone. They seemed drunk to me.

I had a little chat with the girls. They were really pretty. They thanked me again for supporting them. We asked each other where we’re from and then went our separate ways.

And I wonder if this is a regular occurrence here as I’ve just recently moved here.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.49,0,52,2023

3823,submission,13wrz80,2023-05-31 21:07:24,"Pedestrian scratched my parked car. I live in a residence hotel. I park my car (new, 10 days old) in the basement parking of the residence. Today, I found a scratch on the rear back side. Around 4 cm long and really visible. After some research, with the help of the residence security, I found that it was done by another resident, one day ago, when he tried to pass between my parked car and another parked car, with his bike. There is undeniable evidence, that he tried to pass through the cars, slams his bike pedal on my car and then reverses to come out and try another way out. The guy apparently could not care less and did not notify anyone about this. Anyway, I made the security today to call him, because he is not at the residence, travelling abroad to his country. His claim was that he did not notice that his bike hit my car and that we can discuss when he returns next month. This seems quite a BS, as it is so clear that he hit my car and he is fully aware about it, because he changes mind and return back after the hit.

What is the most civilised, polite, calm and respectful way to handle this? Do I need to involve authorities/insurances/hotel management? If he had tried to inform me ir the security about it, I would have forgot about it.

Edit: Police was involved. The whole issue could not be handled as traffic accident and hence no report could be issued. It was handled as property damage. I was asked if I want to open a case, which I denied and expressed the interest to get my car fixed (of course not on my expense). Notes: 1) I had to visit 3 stations because the one was sending me to the other as it was not the correct that is responsible for my area. 2) Station officers were more than helpful, especially when they realised I have undeniable evidence. 3) I was sent back to the residence, where a patrol car arrived. 4) Officers took photos of the car, of my documents, looked the video from my camera and from residence's cameras. 5) Officers requested from residence managers to reveal name and phone number of the person seen on video (I was further away and this info was not revealed to me).  6) Officers transmitted info to their station through a tablet and radio. They were also seemed to make phone calls. 7) They told me to visit car dealership and get my car repaired, take the invoice and bring it to the police station. 8) Station will transmit invoice to the person responsible for the damage. Funny side note. The only police person that expressed slight different response (""why you care for such a scratch. Take a pencil and draw it, it will not be visible""), was a lady officer. Which it only proves that females don't really understand the pain that males go through, when their new cars get hurt! 

Edit: Thanks to everyone that expressed positive and constructive comments (except of course some comments that contained violence and hate. Not funny guys. And also the guy that was asking the car model, and that involving the police is bs, because they have more important things to do.).",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.95,41,43,2023

I am here on a five year multiple entry tourist visa. There is a lot of confusion here on the terms of the visa, and different people are giving different answers, so wanted to check if anyone here or someone known to anyone here has had an experience with this visa. The doubts that I have are:

Is there a limit on the number of entries per year I can make on this visa (A response from GDFRAD to my query mentions that I can only enter UAE twice a year on this visa, however, no such restriction exists as per the telephone agent I spoke to)

Is there a limit to the total number of days I can spend in the country on this visa? Online sources say that there is a limit of 90 days per visit, which can be extended once as long as the total number of days per year is less than 180 days. However, one of the telephone agents I spoke to says that there is a limit of 90 days per year which cannot be extended. The email from GDFRAD says that two visits of upto 90 days each are allowed.

The most logical explanation would be that there is no limit on the number of visits as long as number of days per visit is less than 90 and total number of days spent per year is less than 180. But I am struggling to get a confirmation on this.

In the near future I'm going to buy an apartment in Dubai, I want to ask knowledgeable people, maybe someone has already gone through this

How can I buy a property for cash? I know that I need to do a manager's check, but what risks can I face while doing this? As a non-resident I can't do a manager's check and companies help with that, is that legal?

I've heard that companies that do manager's checks close and even if I make a successful purchase, I may not be able to sell my apartment.

I've also seen ads that developers sell real estate for cryptocurrency, how does this process work?

My job doesn't pay me enough but overloads me with work. I'm not reaping any benefits of my time and energy spent in this country. I'm just losing my health and sanity. Please don't think life is easy here in Dubai. It's hell! Especially for expats. The bling is only for the rich, the rest have to slog and suffer till they have nothing else to lose or migrate to a another country and have a better life. It's 6am in the morning and I'm not with my wife who misses cuddling me to sleep tonight. Yes my situation is better than people who don't live with their families but to each their own. I don't know what is the point of this post. I don't know why I'm writing this either. I hope you all have a better work life than me. I hope you get to spend good quality time with your families. Family is everything.

Edit - For those asking me to leave and why I came here if I don't like it. I've been living here since I was 6. I came here with my parents in 2002 and have been here since. I didn't technically choose to come here. Everyone's got different priorities in life and if work life balance is your priority, this place might not be for you. Most companies don't have fixed working hours and don't think twice before calling you outside working hours. Even if you insist on it, there are more chances of you being antagonized than understood. This isn't just the case with my field of work, I've seen it for others I know as well. This is the case in most Asian countries. Western Culture is different in that aspect. Yes there are a few tradeoffs but as I said before if your priority is work life balance then you'd understand my venting. If you don't understand then you could at least try rather than being rude. A little humanity goes a long way which is exactly what I was crying for in this post. Sorry to bother tho. You can carry on with your lifestyle hating on others. You do you. I was just venting.

For those sending me positive and hopeful messages. Thank you so much. For those who are in the same ship, you're not alone.

Being a new driver im taking a cheaper car for that i can learn more about the dubai road and get more experience. I will upgrade to a better car in next 6-9months. Also as im new here my earnings have just started and not trying to spend too much now.

3886,submission,147jvnx,2023-06-12 13:38:06,"Is Dubai liveable? I think it is. My cost of living and quality of life break down 
I've been here for 7 months now, here's my take on things.

My current cost of living in Dubai as a single male law graduate under 30 from South Asia in a good company but not working in the field of law at all:

I earn between 6-7k AED as it's my first job here.
-1500 for Small partition room (nice one, bed, wardrobe, window, AC in a good community)
-300 for car lift to work (paying for my driving license currently)
-550 for driving license card installment (6 months)
-1200 to send back home for my parents
- Eating low cost meals 15-25AED per day from out costs me 450-800 AED a month.
From Balance 2000 to 1650 AED to save up and for my other expenses.

Later:
After getting my driving license, I'll soon have to buy a cheap car with downpayment and move into a studio apartment farther away and find a roommate. Rent for the studio (22-30k yearly) will cost about 2300-2700 a month which I'll split in half with a roommate. This includes utilities (water, electricity, DEWA, etc.) 
There's also fuel so about 450-600 perhaps.

~

You can scrape by or live decently with 5k+ AED. Even with 2k-3500+ AED but you'll be sharing your accomodation with others then. Satwa single partition rooms are around 900, shared rooms are about 350-400. So yes, manageable, but with sacrifice to privacy.

Quality of life: find balance, live closer to work for less time commuting at higher expense or do the opposite.

Safety: Very very high.

Food and availability of products from around the world: Incredible.

Social aspect: tough to make friends unless you find the right people, easier afterwards. People are generally friendly subject to human nature you'd find anywhere around the world.

Climate: Perfect in winter, stay in AC during summer.

Clothing: New is expensive at 40-100 AED, but flea markets and thrift shops are awesome at 5-10 AED for tops and bottoms.

You can live according to your salary, if you're smart about it and don't run after bling, fast food, credit cards (deadly), and cook your own meals at home.

For all of the above, I'm happy here. Dubai gives you a better quality of life than most home countries and disposable income as well.

Smart approach: leave after 2-3 years to western countries as GCC work experience is legit, get citizenship in those countries, return to Dubai with a Canada, UK, US, Aussie, etc. passport and you will get paid a lot more than a South Asian one. Then, Dubai becomes the best option hands down. Especially when it comes to safety for self and family. 

~ Jobs ~

Finding jobs: LinkedIn is king here. Worked for me. Then there are sites like Naukri gulf, talent, indeed, etc. Dubizzle is meh. 

Three great fields to work in here (feel free to add on more):
- Teaching: Plenty of vacations, rent paid by the school/institution, amazing work life balance.

- Retail: It's the shopping capital of the world. Jobs are plentiful, but target better companies. A sales person can make 2k at a basic shop, but they can also make 7-10k at a high end store, and then there's commissions. Less work life balance, work during holidays, 6 days a week and no weekends though.

- Hospitality: Hotels, etc. but not low level. Target being team leaders, managers, etc. More perks and better work environments. 

Bad jobs (underpaid and/or tiring):

- Anything outdoors: Security, Valet, Insurance and other outdoor salesperson, delivery riders, construction, maintenance, etc. You will suffer.

- Anything with no respect for your work life balance (including low level roles in Hotels, legal and admin at medium to small scale businesses, etc.) 

Expect good standards and always move to better companies when time permits.

~
Good companies offer annual return tickets home, good benefits, mandatory time off, no overtime or overtime rewarded as paid Time in Leave (mandatory), good work culture with happy staff who stay there for years and years, good promotion structures, etc. These companies exist, try good groups like Al Tayer (Al Tayer Insignia, Al Tayer Motors) and Western run businesses, generally higher salaries and better policies).

I've heard negatives about companies like MAF group and Indian run companies for lower salaries and benefits.

A company must also always cover your Visa, medical and insurance costs entirely. It's illegal for them to ask you to pay for these.
~

Another understated fact of Dubai: Efficiency. Public services, administration, infrastructure, transportation, etc. It's flawlessly fast, efficient and top notch. Not even Western countries have systems this efficient. And using your fingerprint or EID and Smart Pass everywhere even online makes ID verification a breeze. This country is miles ahead when it comes to what makes a country a truly developed country when it comes to services.",1,"['dubai', 'uae', 'arabic', 'people', 'sharjah', 'country', 'abu', 'dhabi', 'emirates', 'like']",uae_cities_region,0.81,39,59,2023

It is disappointing to see the administrators and CEO of the website to double-down on their stance, but I am hopeful that we will see some positive change still. Reddit is a site that is near and dear to many and of course, we all want this site and its subs to be a place for community and discussion.

In that light, I recognize that a lot of individuals utilize this subreddit for questions, support, to find friends, to organize meets and for all these other great uses that the founders of this subreddit and myself could never have imagined when we first created it. The blackout would rob this community and its users (who contribute to making r/DubaiCentral a great place everyday) of these uses. 

I appreciate and understand that a number of users may be upset with this change in stance, or the fact that r/Dubai intends on continuing forth the blackout for 48 hours while we change our stance. However, I would like to concede the point that unless each and every single sub is willing to sacrifice its community and users, we will not make any meaningful impacts to reddit. This extends to communities beyond Dubai and even the UAE as a whole.

I'm currently incorporating a company in Dubai so the next step would be to open a bank account.

My biggest issue with most offers I found online is the fact that there's huge 2% commission for international payments. I'm constantly moving between EU and UAE, so paying a 2% commission per each cup of coffee purchased in EU is just insane.

**Is there anything like Revolut Business in the UAE, basically ""online-only"" banks that have very low fees and very good exchange rates?**

Here are my requirements:

\- It should be a company account, not a personal account;

\- A fixed monthly fee, not 0.5% + X AED pe transaction if it's July in a odd year and the Moon is counterput with Venus (aka ""we're randomly commissioning every and each incoming/outgoing transaction"");

\- I should be able to open accounts in EUR;

\- I should be able to attach a Debit card to he EUR account;

\- No (or small?) fees for international payments.

All the above are covered by most fintechs in EU and US, like Revolut, Wise, Monese etc. Is there something similar in Dubai as well?

I'm an Australian. Male 36yo but youthful, but at the same time have an aura of maturity. 

Have travelled for work and lived all over the world before, and am now going to be based in Dubai for the foreseeable future, and I'm well aware that the emirate is made up of a vast majority of expats/non locals... 

But I'd just like to meet locals and get to know them. Without it being weird or going to some milked up cultural event where you don't really get to meet locals and get to know about them in a normal setting. 

Wherever I've lived, I have loved assimilating and just pretending as much as I can that I'm a local. It's normal for me to blend in enough that I don't get hassled by sellers at shops like I'm a tourist. 

And for me, I am super open and love to experience local, authentic culture and authentic food. 

I've got millions of questions I'd ask and would just cherish opportunities to just hang out and do what they do, for example. 

I wanna wear a dishdash but I don't even know if it's offensive if you're not arabic. 
I've had plenty of arabic descendant friends back in Australia and smoked hookah and experienced some amazing food. 

I guess ultimately for me it'd just be cool to just know some local people and become friends.

I've always seen a lot when I've walked through the mall later in the day or evening, and always said hello and shook hands if in an elevator and they've always seemed so lovely and kind and respectful. But never been in a situation where I've felt it appropriate to exchange numbers and hang out. I don't want it to come across like I want something from them or anything either!

Hi everyone,

I have a question regarding the possibility of selling units/apartments of a small building that is owned by an individual rather than a company. Currently, the property is in the name of the individual, and the building is still in the design stage. The owner is considering selling apartments as a means to generate income for constructing the building.

Is it legally and practically feasible for an individual to sell units/apartments in this situation? Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

The company is relatively new and not as established as I thought. My boss keeps making excuses, and I'm afraid of facing legal consequences or losing my university studies. I'm seeking advice while trying to stay anonymous due to financial constraints.**

Hey Reddit,

I wanted to share my current situation and seek some advice. So, I joined a new company back in January, after cancelling my previous job. I was excited about the opportunity and the chance to explore a new career path. However, things have taken an unexpected turn.

After joining the company, I discovered that it was relatively new, only around six months old, and not as experienced as I initially thought. It also turned out that there are only three employees, including myself. This raised some red flags for me, but since I have experience in marketing, especially in social media, I decided to give it a chance.

The problem arose when my boss applied for my labor permit, which took much longer than anticipated. Normally, it should have been approved within three days, but it ended up taking a whole week. During this time, I stayed silent and tried to learn more about the company and its products, which are completely different from what I'm used to.

As the cancellation period for my previous visa was approaching, I started asking my boss about the progress of my permit. He assured me that everything would be sorted out before the deadline and even promised to cover any fines incurred by the delay. However, he kept making excuses, blaming delays caused by the PRO from his other company.

Now, I find myself 6+ months past the cancellation period, which means I have overstayed my visa. If I were to go and clear the fines myself, I could potentially end up in jail. This situation has put me on edge, and I'm scared every time I step outside or take the metro. Unfortunately, stories like this are not uncommon in Dubai.

To make matters worse, I'm attending university on weekends, and my studies are being affected by this ordeal. I live paycheck to paycheck, and I don't have the financial means to seek proper legal help, which is why I'm reaching out to the Reddit community.

I would appreciate any advice or suggestions you can offer while keeping my anonymity intact. Thank you all in advance for your support.",18,"['visa', 'passport', 'citizenship', 'golden', 'canada', 'country', 'passports', 'expats', 'company', 'visas']",immigration,1.0,3,5,2023
3972,submission,14bybpl,2023-06-17 22:39:19,"My Family's Dubai Horror Story My Aunt runs a salon in sweden and wanted to settle in Dubai, so she bought a house there. While looking for salon, and equipment some person defrauded her of some 15,000 AED. Her friends suggested her that she should report it to police, Dubai police is very great, very helpful and will resolve her case and will help her get her money back. My Aunt and my whole family had heard great things about the police there so she decided to do it.
She went to the police station, she was redirected from one counter to other for 4 hours. She almost gave up, but then she was called to 4th floor. (Please note that she was alone and does not know Arabic) There again after a lot of waiting she lost her patience, some officer was coming to give the papers to her, so she took it directly from his hands and had a very frustrated look on her face. She realised she did something wrong and profusely apologized.
Now the Horror part starts.
The officer became highly offended by it.
He put her in prison for a day for this, accused her of fighting, abusing, throwing papers at his face, and what not. All senseless accusations.
He did not report the fact that she was put in prison or the fact that she is a foreign national on the case.
Highly shook after a day in prison she again apologized. The officer asked her to sign a paper in Arabic saying sign this and she is good to go. She complied. Remember this, it is important.
(Please note no one in our extended family has ever been to prison, and she did not had anything to eat as she is vegetarian and prison only had non veg, prison being prison had sounds of screaming and what not all the time)
She went to a airport as per her scheduled flight, but was informed that there is some case pending so she can not leave the country. She went to a few lawyers for the same and they told her that there is no case filed yet so they can't help. She went to the police station, so they told that they have registered a case. As guides by everyone, she again and again apologized to the officer and he said that he has forgiven her and its all okay. It's others who are angry. He guided to go to public prosecutor to get it resolved. It took 15 days to reach to this stage.
With public prosecutor, he asked the whole story and my aunt told her everything honestly. Prosecutor said this is not worthy of a case, the case does not say anything about prison or her being foreign national. He said he will have word with the officer and will get it cleared. Our whole family was happy.
The next day officer was highly offended as to why did we tell the whole story, how dare she. And what not, the tone of talking changed, he was a different person altogether.
Case went to trial, my aunt was given a Fine, we accepted it, and deposited the fine.
12days after the result, the prosecutor changed the punishment to increased fine, prison time and deportation (as told by embassy).
We contested this in high court, the court did not accept the appeal. We have applied in supreme court, awaiting and hoping the appeal will be accepted.
All this has taken 6 months of her life. She works day and night at her salon to earn money, which in simply burning in her stay and legal fee. She is not able to work/earn while she is there. She has two small kids studying in sweden who she has not met in this while.
On top of all this she might have to go to prison for 3 months.
If anyone can help, then please do. Really tough times for us.",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.88,471,381,2023

So I was surfing through Booking.com and stumbled upon this property. Booking.com website then asked me to enter my card details to see prices in local currency. As soon as I entered my details, it charged my card 17K without any OTP.

I called them immediately, and they asked me to stay on hold till they checked with the property.

Now, while I was on hold, I again looked at the pictures, and guess what? They're using Nakheel and Aura Sky Pool’s images, and when I called Palm Tower, they said nothing under the name LHG Palm exists here and that they've never heard of it.

What are my options here?

Update : BOOKING.COM does have my details and transaction id and booking id. 

But they are the official aggregator of a 3 day old New property and they are authorized to receive payments on The property’s behalf. so they cannot refund back the money without a confirmation from the so called LHG palm. 

And surprisingly their “INVESTIGATION” has concluded that the property doesn’t exist.

Hello, fellow Redditors,

I’m writing this post to share a frustrating experience I recently had with a tailor in Sharjah. I wanted to get a special tailored dress made for my wife for our first Eid together, but unfortunately, it turned out to be a nightmare.

I entrusted this tailor to create a customized dress for my wife, but little did I expect the shocking outcome. Not only did the dress turn out to be of subpar quality, but to my disbelief, I discovered that nearly half of the fabrics I provided had been stolen. It's distressing to imagine that someone could engage in such dishonest practices, particularly during a time when we should be celebrating and cherishing moments with loved ones.

I share this story as a cautionary tale to alert fellow community members about this particular tailor in Rolla, Sharjah. I think people have faced issues with him that’s why he has the least business. Please exercise caution and reconsider utilizing his services. 

If any of you have had similar experiences or know of reputable and reliable tailors in Sharjah or Dubai, I kindly request your suggestions and recommendations.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post and for any support or advice you can provide.

Wishing you all a joyful and blessed Eid!",31,"['italian', 'suit', 'suits', 'guy', 'peace', 'met', 'rest', 'dad', 'leader', 'brother']",unrelated_theme,0.94,13,5,2023

I'm thrilled to share that I recently passed my driving test on my second attempt. Now, I'm eagerly looking to buy a car and would appreciate some advice from those who have been in a similar situation.

To give you some context, I currently earn an 8,000 AED salary and I'm considering financing a car with a monthly payment of around 800 AED. However, I'm a bit uncertain about whether this is a realistic option for me or if I might be making a bad decision. If any of you have experienced something similar, I'd love to hear your insights on how you approached buying your car.

Here are a few specific questions I have:

1. Is it realistic to finance a car with my salary?
2. Are there any specific financing options or dealerships you would recommend?
3. What factors should I consider before making a decision?
4. Are there any additional expenses or hidden costs I should be aware of when buying a car?

I'm open to any advice, personal experiences, or tips you can offer. Your insights would greatly help me make an informed decision about purchasing my first car in Dubai.

For many months now we have been having issues with our lives due to the inhumane conditions we have been subjected to because of our manager/founder and company investor.

Since the start of the company, we were made to wait for a year for our visas to be issued and late salaries was always an issue.

However, in the last few months, things have gotten worse. Our company has been suffering because of the poor management and decisions from our manager. Our April salary was not being paid... Our investor started avoiding us.. We were left in the unknown of what was happening... 

From what we found out that our investor and manager are having troubles are we are collateral damage in their fight.. However, after a lot of begging, we got paid.. 

For May salary, we have still not been paid.. Our investor is avoiding us again.. Our manager has conveniently resigned at this time without taking any responsibility for our well being. Noone is there to look after us. Our investor is avoiding us as usual. 

At this time I am unable to make a salary complaint as I am away on my annual paid leave. However, some of my colleagues have. 

At this point I am not even able to make a court case as I dont have money and me and most of my colleagues have to save money for our rent and car payments, etc..

Our visas are expiring last month and they don't plan on renewing that as well I think.. Noone is even answering our questions.

Our manager says nothing is his fault and blames it on everyone else - although everything has stemmed from his actions.

And our investor is a heartless man who will burn everyone and destroy as many lives as he wants without a care or concern.

There is just noone to help us and it's not easy to resign and find a new job here.. Also there is zero guarantee that we will even get our end of service as we are not even getting our salaries.

3 of our ex-colleagues have posted cases against the company as they did not receive their last month salaries and end of service after they resigned.. This was 3 or 4 months back.. even after posting a labour case, nothing has happened and they have not received anything.. This is why I don't have faith in posting a labour case .. as it is, I cannot afford it...

We don't have HR in the company... Our HR is from our investors main company however, they are never reachable and never listen to us.

Me and my colleagues are suffering because of these 2 people and we have reached a point of helplessness. We all have bills, rent, car payments etc. Neither are they dissolving the company nor are they paying us.. We cannot even benefit from unemployment insurance.

I don't think any company should operate like this and the people responsible for this mess must be held accountable. 

We are all human beings who have feelings and lives that have been ruined because of such incompetent businessmen. We don't know what to do...

For context, I have an employee car lease under my employer that I've had for 6 months. My lease has ended so I returned the car to the Alfa Romeo garage. I filed 2 unknown accident reports, one for a cracked windshield that happened from a falling object from a truck and another that I don't know how it happened (as I noticed it a while later) was an inside punctured tire (leaking air).

For the windshield I received my report (green header) but for the punctured tire it says I'm the liable party even though I didn't hit anyone.

My friend and work colleague had damage to his car that was leased. His wife was coming out of the parking lot and destroyed the passenger door when she hit a pole (huge dent and scratches). He filed his report and sent it for an insurance claim and got it repaired without an issue.

I'm worrying that my damage for the punctured tire, which it says I'm the liable party, won't get covered by insurance whereas my friend's damage caused by his wife was covered.

The guy always delivers water to our flat every weekends where my parents are home, I'm home alone right now this is the first time he delivered on Monday. After he place all the bottle on the floor I noticed him looking everywhere inside like he's observing the flat hes inside close to the door.. The money that my parents gave me for the water is short by 10aed so I went to my room to get 10aed.

after a sec a saw him standing in the living room and I didn't tell him to go there, I just said wait there at the door just seconds ago. After giving him the money he ask where my parents I said they're at work cause I kinda trust him he always delivers to us, he also ask what's my job and I said I'm still looking for work and I'm kinda new here in the uae, he ask for my number so he can refer me to someone he knows that is hiring and I gave my number. 

After that he left and was about to continue job hunting online. He called me and says he wants to go inside our flat and talk to me about the job like wtf and I said I'm busy. And he replied please just 2minutes like wtf why are you begging to talk to me and inside the flat I'm home alone. He constantly says ""please I will go there now"" and I didn't respond to him and he dropped the call. Now he's calling me again so I muted my phone, he called again this time my Phone is on mute and suddenly I heard a ringing sound just outside the door and I walk to the door silently and look through the peeking hole on the door and there he is waiting for me like a creep.

And be kept calling my phone and observing him on the peeking hole. And then suddenly hes trying to open the door knob multiple times, like wtf is wrong with this guy he's there for I think 5 to 10minutes before leaving, so I thought he was so after I saw him leave I'm trying to lock the bolt but it's not fitting in the hole. And then suddenly I think he heard doing something at the door and there he was again but for a short period only. Called my mom what happened and he will talk to manager of the building about it.

A couple weeks ago days after I completed my 2 years obligatory period I got a call from a DU agent, saying that I have to renew for two more years and said it was mandatory if I wanted to continue having internet. As I use internet to work I didn't wanted to have the hassle to look for another company or something even if I thought having to renew for another 2 years contract sounded shady.  
So I said ok lets renew and I thought that will be it and I will continue with my service as usual. But some days after a technician come to my house saying they were giving me another router and another tv device just to update the old ones.

What is my surprise that now that I'm trying to pay my account it appears that I have to pay my old internet account, a new internet account and a deposit fee for the new devices.  


So what I'm thinking is the agent lied to me about having to renew for 2 more years and they sold me a new plan whithout cancelling the previous one?   
I asked for help on DU but the bots are useless and when I got to speak with a human they just told me they don't know anything about it and I have to pay and then put a complain. Which I think its unfair, why would I have to pay 2 internet accounts. :(

I made a payment back in April using the dubai now app via Apple Pay to pay my du. Everything seemed fine and I got a confirmation from dubai now.

I pay the amount again. 

I complain to Amex (card issuer) and say I want a chargeback. That’s been going on for months now with no resolution. I contacted them recently and the reply is wait.

4081,submission,14dgexy,2023-06-19 18:38:00,"Normal or dodged a bullet? Is it normal that Arab women demand first meeting in restaurants, that man is obligated to pay? I was talking for some weeks on social media with this girl, Arab from North Africa. Casual conversations about general stuff. I proposed to meet during the day for a coffee, to see how it goes. She said that prefers to go for dinner. Is not my custom to go first meetings with girls I don't know well to restaurants. I prefer something more relaxed and simple. Anyway, I tried to make it as a joke that we can go somewhere simple, so we can share. She said that Arab girls never pay for dinners and that in her culture the man always pays and calls and organises and that she will never initiate a call to me. I have to be the one calling and paying. And that I will forever be alone here, because with my attitude I will never find anyone.

Edit: It seems that most commenters have understood the general context of what happened. I totally respect and agree that there is a cultural parameter that I probably didn't factor. On the other hand, both parties knew that this was an intercultural relationship in the making, meaning both should be willing to relax their background requirements. Me for example to be ready covering the first meeting and her for example to expect a less fancy first meeting. Thanks a lot to the Arab girls that contributed to this discussion and shed some light.

Some questions:

1. Does this basically mean we have to rule out all restaurants within Burj Khalifa and the Atlantis, or do these restaurants bring you to some outdoor area in order to view the fireworks happening there?

2. Between these two fireworks, which one would you suggest?

3. Any good restaurants recommendations ?Our criteria: Budget up to around USD 900 per person. Western cuisine (no middle eastern/ African cuisine/buffet), Fine dining. We don't drink wine, so that's not a concern. Entertainment-wise, we prefer more quite music &amp; performance, no rock &amp; roll/loud music plz. Ideally, we can view the fireworks outdoor as we look to hear the sound too (ok too if we dine indoor and then brought to outside for fireworks)

4. Instead of restaurants, would dinner cruise/yatch be a good idea too?

5. Heard the traffic on NYE is very chaotic. Is it a must that we book a hotel within walking distance from the restaurant (otherwise we'll to arrive the restaurant early with nothing to do the whole morning)?

To those with experience in the industry, would you recommend making such a move? I have been diligently saving for this potential relocation and would bring years' worth of savings with me.

Any feedback or advice would be immensely appreciated!

4114,submission,14e0eiq,2023-06-20 08:05:37,"Landlord wanted to move into the property but now plans to rent it out to another tenant with 25% increase in rent My landlord sent me a 12 month eviction notice within 1 month of me entering the property. The landlord said they wanted to move into the property and thus we needed to leave the property. This was fine and we had no problems with it. 

Our contract ends in September and i asked the landlord if he is willing to extend the contract another 5 months. I am currently paying 60k per year but the landlord wanted 70k per year, though the next day the landlord said the property is now 75k per year, as according to him this is market value. I have said to the estate agent that there is no chance the property value has risen 15k in 9 months. 

After discussing the estate agent sent me the following message from the landlord ""You still have some time, no? Please find some other tenant! 70 is too less for 4 cheque."". This obviously leads me to believe they want to re-rent the property out to another tenant at 75k. Though we were told to leave the property as the landlord wanted to move in.

We are happy to pay 67k for the year which is over 10% increase in last year rent though the landlord is being extra greedy. 

What can be done about the situation?

1-Road to Bahrain - Gmaps is directing me to take the coastal road after reaching Salwa. I read somewhere that this road has some rough patches in between. Should I skip this road and take a left after Salwa to Road 615 passing by Hofuf then to Khobar?

2- I will be traveling early morning and will be driving a new Civic sedan. Should I coat the front part of the car with the brown spray-on coating to avoid sand damage or is it not necessary? I searched Amazon for the stuff but couldn’t find it.

3-Insurance - Do we require health insurance for Qatar and Bahrain? If yes, then can we purchase it at the border or online beforehand? I have the multiple entry visa for KSA so health is covered for Saudi in that. For visa i am planning to take on arrival for both Bahrain and Qatar.

4-Currency- Is Aed accepted in both the countries or should i keep some local currency with me before the trip?

Realistically, how long will the drive to Manama take? Google is showing me around 9.30 hours in total. I am planning to leave around 4 am on Saturday.

I hope you're all doing well. I'm reaching out to this community today in search of some valuable financial advice to help me overcome my current debt situation. I recently got married and unfortunately find myself in a significant amount of debt, totaling 150,000 AED.

Here's a breakdown of my current financial situation:

* Loan: 75,000 AED
* Credit Card Debt: 32,000 AED

My monthly salary as an engineer is 6,000 AED, and at the moment, my entire salary is being used to pay off my loan and credit card. This leaves me with limited funds for family expenses and prevents me from making substantial progress in reducing my debt.

I'm open to any suggestions or strategies that could help me manage my debt more effectively. If any of you have experienced a similar situation or have successfully overcome a similar debt burden, I would greatly appreciate your insights.

Additionally, if you know of any resources or organizations in Dubai that provide financial assistance or counseling, please do share them as well. I'm looking for ways to gradually pay off my debt and regain financial stability for my family.

I understand that seeking financial assistance from strangers may not always be reliable, but any advice or guidance you can provide would be sincerely appreciated.

Thank you all in advance for your support and assistance.

4158,submission,14efyxr,2023-06-20 20:38:28,"It’s happened again (Dubai Credit Card Scam) Hey Guys,

I had posted a few months back about a credit card scam that took place in my dads credit card. After the help from the sub asking us to report it we were able to get the whole amount back. 

Following this incident my dad had cancelled all the credit cards he had and then applied for a brand new one. This credit card was only used at well known supermarkets/stores and no where dodgy. 

About 2 weeks back 4 transactions in US dollars took place amounting to a total of 24000dhs. We had reported these transactions to the bank and I had contacted the merchant which was some crypto wallet website. The website said they can’t help because it’s a crypto wallet and once a transaction in bitcoin is made they can’t refund it. 

The bank informed us 3 days back that they can’t refund the amount as it was a genuine transaction that was done cause otp was used. Do note that my dad didn’t receive any otp in the mobile number or his email (Only his mobile number is linked to the credit card). I know that it is common for Frauds/hackers to change the mobile number linked to otp and getting to access it that way. 

Following this we reached out to a connection we had at the bank but that yielded no results. 

Now, my question is other than filing a police report (which usually nothing happens since it’s a cyber transaction crime), is there anything else we can do? Is it worth trying to approach this legally with the bank stating that we didn’t receive any otp etc? Is there any other options we can explore?",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,0.5,1,30,2023

Error message on my ""Visa Application list"" that I was advised to ignore:
""An error occurred in process of inspection of the file. Upload a file again. passport number Pxxxxxxxx Name of the file null""
This error message was on my account from 30th May for about 3-4 days. But there was nothing I could do; no option to re-upload my passport, so I ignored it as advised by the consulate and customer hotline when I called them, respectively. 

Uploaded documents:
1. Passport photo (white background)
2. Passport copy (bio page and the following page) 
3. Emirates ID copy
4. Flight itinerary (already booked but pre-booking works as per requirements)
5. Bank statement last 3 months
6. Certificate of Employment (NOT NOC)
7. Schedule of Stay (use the form they provide on the website)
8. Hotel booking confirmation (pre-booking)
9. Residence visa copy (document to prove legal residency)

Notes: 
1. I uploaded all the above in pdf format, except for my passport photo. If you have more than one file per required document, you should upload in jpg or PNG format. 
However, even though I have 2 accommodations, I just merged them in 1 file and uploaded it in pdf like the rest.
 
2. Some required fields (like the hotel booking information) have limited character spaces, so if for example you have 2 accommodations, just write the contact number of the accommodation where you will stay the longest. As for the hotel name, try to write both. (What's more important is you write all your accommodation info on the Schedule of Stay form)

3. Schedule of Stay form. Just write ""Arrival to Japan via xx airport"" on your Day 0. I also added my accommodation info on Day 0 as this is the day I am moving there from the airport.

We are staying long term (We have been here 8yrs and at least another 5 years which is as long term as Dubai planning goes) so we are considering buying instead of renting. But I am conflicted on whether to buy in JLT (Cluster O - V) as these are most child friendly Or go for a villa in one of these gated communities. We have always lived in Marina or JLT in the 8yrs and its been nice, multicultural, all services established etc.  I think I have read too many horror stories on here about villa investments so I am inclined to stick to the area I know the problems etc. 

Also the prices seem more stable in these old areas and I feel like they are established enough that they won't collapse like some of the newer developments like Emaar South.

There is one cluster which they are starting now and selling off plan, worth considering or is off plan a huge gamble.

I'm (28M) currently on the verge of moving to a new rented apartment with my wife and while I've looked into buying a property, I personally feel I need to put in more time and research into making a purchase decision as big as this one, which will likely last 20+ years. However, some people I've talked to have told me that instead of paying rent, why don't I put in the same monthly rent towards paying an EMI for buying a property. This has made me feel as though renting an apartment is not the right way forward and my money is going to waste.   


Before I make a decision to purchase a property, I aim to be at a higher salary bracket and in a more stable job. These are some basic pre-requisites for me. I certainly have the plan to purchase a property perhaps 1-2 years from now once I've done some thorough research and I'm in a comfortable place financially as well. To add on to this, the property prices right now are quite high, i obviously wouldn't want to buy when it's at its peak.   


As of now, am i making the right decision to rent or shall i look into buying a property instead?",24,"['rent', 'landlord', 'property', 'estate', 'agent', 'rental', 'apartment', 'real', 'tenant', 'renting']",real_estate_housing,0.5,1,0,2023

Recently they’ve crossed the line, now I’m local so I’m surrounded by other local “friends” who recently started making fun of me for wearing a mask in public and actually social distancing... because they claim it’s not “manly” let me clarify some things: 1)not wearing a mask does not compensate for your micro/limp excuse of a reproductive organ. 2)my grandma has been wearing a niqab for 20+ years and her left pinky is more of a bad-ass than you shit-stains. My sister and her daughter have recently been diagnosed with Covid and are in stable conditions now, but my sister pointed out that in her occasional office visits NONE of her clients would be wearing masks while she always tried her best to follow proper procedures.

Some of these meds are fairly expensive and I'd hate to throw them away. That said, I would hate it even more to fall in any kind of trouble for being on the wrong side of the law. 


It's all over-the-counter pills; nothing that requires prescriptions (such as strong painkillers, antibiotics, or stuff related to psychiatry).


edit: For those who are interested, it's diaurates, blood thinners, and medications to regulate high BP. The blood thinners in particular are extremely expensive.",13,"['covid', 'vaccine', 'virus', '19', 'vaccinated', 'coronavirus', 'cases', 'hospital', 'sinopharm', 'symptoms']",health.covid,0.75,2,2,2021

His birthday is coming up early June, and thankfully this year i managed to collect some savings that i’m planning to spend on his bday gift. i have around 500DHS rn.

however, when i went online to try and find a cat, they all were way more expensive than i anticipated. Cheapest was 1000DHS which is double what i have.

Idk what to do and i really wanna get him a cat this year. He’s been kinda feeling down and lonely lately  too so i think this is the best thing i could give him.

Looking for one or two roommate(s) to live with in International City Phase 1 in Studio/Masterbed. 

Monthly rent here is much cheaper max 2500/month. And studio and master apartments are way better and spacious than those claustrophobic bed spaces 🤮

Cost will be 1000-1200 per month in a spacious room, which is very good imo. We will try to look for one which includes all bills. We have to search there for studios/master beds. 

I don't mind a person of any ethnicity/religion. But the roommate should be trustable. This is the most important thing for me.

Please let me know. I have to shift before 1st of June",-1,"['dubai', 'people', 'just', 'like', 'don', 'uae', 'know', 'time', 'good', 'https']",undefined,1.0,9,8,2022
