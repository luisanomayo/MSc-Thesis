"31702","comment","hjjhl9r","2021","Purely just my opinion - brokers/landlords trying to artificially drive up the demand by hiking the prices. And someone who has FOMO could very well get into the idea of not missing out, see the upward trend and try and get in to the real estate market now. Especially who are in here for expo, and could very much well be interested in living in Dubai/UAE because of the response to Covid here.

But on the other hand, what after expo? I don't think there will be any other reason or directive to keep increasing the rental prices or even the property prices. Once the extra people leave - all those who are employed at expo/just visiting expo and then when the tourist season is also over. What after that? Most likely we will see late 2020s prices again or even lower.

Obviously, if someone has a better perspective, I am all ears.","purely opinion brokers landlords trying artificially drive demand hiking prices fomo idea missing upward trend try real estate market especially expo interested living dubai uae response covid hand expo think reason directive increasing rental prices property prices extra people leave employed expo visiting expo tourist season likely late 2020s prices lower obviously better perspective ears","55","['purely', 'opinion', 'broker', 'landlord', 'try', 'artificially', 'drive', 'demand', 'hiking', 'price', 'fomo', 'idea', 'miss', 'upward', 'trend', 'try', 'real', 'estate', 'market', 'especially', 'expo', 'interested', 'living', 'dubai', 'uae', 'response', 'covid', 'hand', 'expo', 'think', 'reason', 'directive', 'increase', 'rental', 'price', 'property', 'price', 'extra', 'people', 'leave', 'employ', 'expo', 'visit', 'expo', 'tourist', 'season', 'likely', 'late', '2020s', 'price', 'low', 'obviously', 'well', 'perspective', 'ear']"

I came to Dubai in the early 90s. Etisalat, as I told one of its staff last week, was one of the most cutting edge companies in the  region. They were sending printed newsletters, called Tawasul, to my PO Box  about something called the Internets, they installed my land line the next day with my preferred number that I chose after flipping several sheets of numbers. That same week there was a news report from Egypt that a man died of a heart attack because of the sudden joy to learn that he won the telephone lottery, he was selected to have a phone line and a number instead of the usual 10 year waiting list. A British dude started an audio service to read your astrological sign, 10 AED per call, he made a killing, with every bored secretary or call center staff trying their luck daily, 
until a complaint caused his operation to close, it was a romantic note that caused the complaint.

Regarding garages, there's no way to be sure if they're cheating you or not. It's best if you know the owner personally imo, if you find a good one stick with them. 
If you don't mind paying higher some of the reputed ones  and dealerships are honest but they charge a fat premium for it. You can try Max Garage and Deutsche Auto Werks for just inspecting your vehicle.

You can also come to us for a second opinion if you feel like the prices are too high, we charge maybe 2/3rds of the price, most of the time lower.","need knows cars issues easy check obd scanner tool cheap ones read error codes helps look internet obvious issues garages way sure cheating best know owner personally going find good stick mind paying higher reputed ones dealerships honest charge fat premium try max garage deutsche auto werks inspecting vehicle come second opinion feel like prices high charge maybe 2 3rds price time lower","63","['need', 'know', 'car', 'issue', 'easy', 'check', 'obd', 'scanner', 'tool', 'cheap', 'one', 'read', 'error', 'code', 'help', 'look', 'internet', 'obvious', 'issue', 'garage', 'way', 'sure', 'cheat', 'well', 'know', 'owner', 'personally', 'go', 'find', 'good', 'stick', 'mind', 'pay', 'high', 'reputed', 'one', 'dealership', 'honest', 'charge', 'fat', 'premium', 'try', 'max', 'garage', 'deutsche', 'auto', 'werk', 'inspect', 'vehicle', 'come', 'second', 'opinion', 'feel', 'like', 'price', 'high', 'charge', 'maybe', '2', '3rds', 'price', 'time', 'lower']"

They provided the best care for our baby (was shifted to NICU within minutes of birth) and today by god’s grace and thanks to their actions, our child is as normal as a child can be.

The nurses and the pediatricians in the NICU were patient and honest with us, they gave us regular updates and took the time to answer all our questions. It was a trying time for us and they were very supportive.

It is difficult to explain our emotions then but it is suffice to say that I was never ever bothered when my child cried as a baby as it was a sign that he was alive and kicking❤️","look hypnobirthing sounds like hippy stuff worked wonders partner help pain management educated prepared dealing emergencies comment black listing al zahra wanted add baby born dubai complications birth team fantastic provided best care baby shifted nicu minutes birth today gods grace thanks actions child normal child nurses pediatricians nicu patient honest gave regular updates took time answer questions trying time supportive difficult explain emotions suffice bothered child cried baby sign alive kicking","72","['look', 'hypnobirthing', 'sound', 'like', 'hippy', 'stuff', 'work', 'wonder', 'partner', 'help', 'pain', 'management', 'educate', 'prepared', 'deal', 'emergency', 'comment', 'black', 'list', 'al', 'zahra', 'want', 'add', 'baby', 'bear', 'dubai', 'complication', 'birth', 'team', 'fantastic', 'provide', 'good', 'care', 'baby', 'shift', 'nicu', 'minute', 'birth', 'today', 'god', 'grace', 'thank', 'action', 'child', 'normal', 'child', 'nurse', 'pediatricians', 'nicu', 'patient', 'honest', 'give', 'regular', 'update', 'take', 'time', 'answer', 'question', 'try', 'time', 'supportive', 'difficult', 'explain', 'emotion', 'suffice', 'bother', 'child', 'cry', 'baby', 'sign', 'alive', 'kicking']"

Looking for one or two roommate(s) to live with in International City Phase 1 in Studio/Masterbed. 

Monthly rent here is much cheaper max 2500/month. And studio and master apartments are way better and spacious than those claustrophobic bed spaces 🤮

Cost will be 1000-1200 per month in a spacious room, which is very good imo. We will try to look for one which includes all bills. We have to search there for studios/master beds. 

I don't mind a person of any ethnicity/religion. But the roommate should be trustable. This is the most important thing for me.

Please let me know.

"64518","comment","iarfwgl","2022","This post reminds me of an incident- I used to stay on the mezzanine floor with a big balcony- - generally people in the upper floor were considerate and would not throw crap into my balcony-as the design was such that my balcony was of the bigger width than theirs!!

But the lady in the top floor right above me , would constantly throw her pet fur by dusting her pet bed and carpet on the balcony- -since I wasn’t using it other than drying clothes , I did not think much of it!!

One morning we decided to eat breakfast out- and we arrange and just sit and she can definitely see us from her angle  still decides to dust pet fur filled carpet right into us!- I called out to her and she just off handedly said ok and went off inside!!! No apologies!!!

And I think one day her very very expensive pet carpet fell into my balcony,, I just left it there hoping she would come get it! -she did not and it kept lying there for a couple of days- I just put it to the corner!!! More visible to her... after another few days another expensive carpet- I did not pick it -since I work almost 12 hrs a day plus travel- I am in the house for limited hour’s,,so I guess even if she did come to pick it - I did not knw , nor did she leave a note!

Then one afternoon  someone banged on my door - we just sat for lunch- we eat food on floor in a very traditional Asian way- so I told her to come back later and pick it !!! She made a big fuss and and screamed loudly( racial slur included-becse I’m brown and she is a privileged white) - I refused to let her in side the house and  she threatened to call the cops on me!!!! Saying I stole her expensive carpets !!!

I laughed at her breakdown and said sure - call the cops and closed the door!!  

She banged many times on my door ,, I have Chinese -Arabic neighbors who came out and everyone watching!!!

Afterwards one of  her friend comes and knocks my door and very politely apologize for her friend - I refused to accept her apology and said her friend need to apologize- but friend wouldn’t come to do that!!!  Her friend  started a story about how covid pressure and loss of job made her behave like that!!! 

I did not accept the apology and told her friend call the cops!!! 

I left for my duty and a couple of days later the neighbors told me she had to vacate cause of unable to meet rent!!!

But imagine threatening me with calling cops  for two carpets she dropped and refused to pick up and over time both completely covered by fur she kept throwing her pet fur down!!

Karma works in its own ways!

Not all neighbors I have had over the years behaved like this- most were generally nice and cordial!!

But some really make us think about how the Karen’s need to be given their own meds!!

After that I have never again stayed on mez floors as I don’t want such things to repeat and now love the higher floors!

Long reply!!!

Why not? since it is for the benefit of women and also it is their demand. You have specially positioned parking and metro cabins in Dubai for example. It is not ""Women only"". But ""All parking are available for everyone, and an additional (for women only) parking is also provided to ensure safety, ease and better quality of life.

Women parking are usually closer to the facility so they don't have to walk a lot in the middle of the heat, let alone the children that she take care of. That's one of many blesses of the UAE mother, an active member of society...

I went for an interview at a Dubai based law firm full of Indian lawyers run by a well known Indian lawyer - they said they would love to have a British lawyer as it would be good for the firms reputation, but could hire around 10 Indian lawyers for the same cost, so they couldn’t justify hiring me….  I don’t know if that means the Indian lawyers are making more money here than they would in India, or whether there’s some other benefit which means they prefer it here. It also means the job market is skewed slightly as many business owners are taking full advantage of this and will only hire Indian qualified people because they can get away with paying them less. I’ve seen it in family offices and also in the medical profession too.

Business owners take advantage of the situation and I’m sorry to say even if you quit or turn down a job, they will easily find a replacement. Its a terrible market.

If you want catered suggestions, why not do something that your wife always says she wants to try but was not able to for whatever reason.

For example, my wife really wanted to try sky diving, although it's not really a couples thing, I did the next best thing which was dinner in the sky.

If you have any idea of some personal touch but not sure how to translate it into an anniversary thing, list it here and Im sure the sub won't disappoint.","makes anniversary special personal touch fancy personalization pretty expensive want catered suggestions wife says wants try able reason example wife wanted try sky diving couples thing best thing dinner sky idea personal touch sure translate anniversary thing list sure sub disappoint","41","['make', 'anniversary', 'special', 'personal', 'touch', 'fancy', 'personalization', 'pretty', 'expensive', 'want', 'catered', 'suggestion', 'wife', 'say', 'want', 'try', 'able', 'reason', 'example', 'wife', 'want', 'try', 'sky', 'diving', 'couple', 'thing', 'good', 'thing', 'dinner', 'sky', 'idea', 'personal', 'touch', 'sure', 'translate', 'anniversary', 'thing', 'list', 'sure', 'sub', 'disappoint']"

Tbh I tried offering to split the bill but the guy always insists and says “ next time you can pay “ lol but yeah it’s best to go for coffee or tea , I guess Tim Hortons is quite reasonable

And the dating struggle is real for both the gender here in dubai . This is a transit location and no one is here for too long , if you are up for casuals then it’s easy but finding someone for the long run can be challenging. Meeting people organically is usually through work / school or uni .. I don’t think the Meetup and networking groups should be the place to hunt for people to date as you are there for other professional purposes. It can be better and easier for extroverts tho.","women dates free food new lol going date barely eat m usually excited kind takes away hunger spending time getting know meeting people dating apps best filter yes process maybe slow lead impatient best way avoid gold diggers honest tried offering split bill guy insists says time pay lol yeah best coffee tea guess tim hortons reasonable dating struggle real gender dubai transit location long casuals easy finding long run challenging meeting people organically usually work school uni think meetup networking groups place hunt people date professional purposes better easier extroverts","91","['woman', 'date', 'free', 'food', 'new', 'lol', 'going', 'date', 'barely', 'eat', 'm', 'usually', 'excited', 'kind', 'take', 'away', 'hunger', 'spending', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'meet', 'people', 'date', 'app', 'well', 'filter', 'yes', 'process', 'maybe', 'slow', 'lead', 'impatient', 'good', 'way', 'avoid', 'gold', 'digger', 'honest', 'try', 'offer', 'split', 'bill', 'guy', 'insist', 'say', 'time', 'pay', 'lol', 'yeah', 'good', 'coffee', 'tea', 'guess', 'tim', 'horton', 'reasonable', 'date', 'struggle', 'real', 'gender', 'dubai', 'transit', 'location', 'long', 'casual', 'easy', 'find', 'long', 'run', 'challenge', 'meeting', 'people', 'organically', 'usually', 'work', 'school', 'uni', 'think', 'meetup', 'network', 'group', 'place', 'hunt', 'people', 'date', 'professional', 'purpose', 'well', 'easy', 'extrovert']"

Locals are masters of prostitutions :P And prostitution in the UAE isn't exactly subtle.

I don't care where someone is educated, I dropped out of university but still did pretty well in my career through hard work.
However I've interviewed some people with 2 degrees who could hardly answer a few basic questions when asked.

To me job based knowledge, work ethic, communication skills, general writing skills, critical thinking, initiative, ability to take constructive critiscm, ownership, English language skills are all really important for me and the companies I've worked for.

It's difficult to explain without sounding prejudiced but certain ways of working I've seen from individuals from certain countries are not really compatible with the corporate culture of some businesses. 

As an example, where I'm from it is considered acceptable to challenge your boss on why decisions are made,  to acknowledge mistakes and accept responsibility, to say no to work when you think it can't be done or don't have time.  With a lot of Indian colleagues I've worked with, they would say that those sorts of things would be unacceptable in their work culture.  

I hope you take that in the way it was meant.  Just that in my experience as a Westerner, it can be difficult trying to adapt to Indian workplace culture and I'm sure the same true in reverse.  Whether this is an issue or not depends on the individual and the business involved.   This may in turn affect peoples hiring decisions.","degrees far experience far important 2 3 years workplace care educated dropped university pretty career hard work interviewed people 2 degrees hardly answer basic questions asked job based knowledge work ethic communication skills general writing skills critical thinking initiative ability constructive critiscm ownership english language skills important companies worked difficult explain sounding prejudiced certain ways working seen individuals certain countries compatible corporate culture businesses example considered acceptable challenge boss decisions acknowledge mistakes accept responsibility work think time lot indian colleagues worked sorts things unacceptable work culture hope way meant experience westerner difficult trying adapt indian workplace culture sure true reverse issue depends individual business involved turn affect peoples hiring decisions","110","['degree', 'far', 'experience', 'far', 'important', '2', '3', 'year', 'workplace', 'care', 'educate', 'drop', 'university', 'pretty', 'career', 'hard', 'work', 'interview', 'people', '2', 'degree', 'hardly', 'answer', 'basic', 'question', 'ask', 'job', 'base', 'knowledge', 'work', 'ethic', 'communication', 'skill', 'general', 'writing', 'skill', 'critical', 'thinking', 'initiative', 'ability', 'constructive', 'critiscm', 'ownership', 'english', 'language', 'skill', 'important', 'company', 'work', 'difficult', 'explain', 'sound', 'prejudiced', 'certain', 'way', 'work', 'see', 'individual', 'certain', 'country', 'compatible', 'corporate', 'culture', 'business', 'example', 'consider', 'acceptable', 'challenge', 'boss', 'decision', 'acknowledge', 'mistake', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'work', 'think', 'time', 'lot', 'indian', 'colleague', 'work', 'sort', 'thing', 'unacceptable', 'work', 'culture', 'hope', 'way', 'mean', 'experience', 'westerner', 'difficult', 'trying', 'adapt', 'indian', 'workplace', 'culture', 'sure', 'true', 'reverse', 'issue', 'depend', 'individual', 'business', 'involve', 'turn', 'affect', 'people', 'hire', 'decision']"

The five hundred Euros per person we spent on three days in Dubai (incl. two nights in Sharjah, 1000km drive, traffic jams, international insurance for our Omani rental and entrance fee for Burj Khalifa) were my most regretted spending. In retrospect, we really should have split the three days into one day splashing about at Wadi Shab, one more visit to the Nakhl hot springs , and one in the Jebel Shams, going the Balcony Walk again.

I noticed you dropped 28 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

1) wearing a mask when you’re walking in a street with no human in a 10 km radius is not necessary. 

2) Removing your mask while talking to people defeats the purpose of wearing a mask.

If you do this you’re a fucking idiot. Although good for you because Natural selection will take care of your stupidity.

Recently they’ve crossed the line, now I’m local so I’m surrounded by other local “friends” who recently started making fun of me for wearing a mask in public and actually social distancing... because they claim it’s not “manly” let me clarify some things: 1)not wearing a mask does not compensate for your micro/limp excuse of a reproductive organ. 2)my grandma has been wearing a niqab for 20+ years and her left pinky is more of a bad-ass than you shit-stains. My sister and her daughter have recently been diagnosed with Covid and are in stable conditions now, but my sister pointed out that in her occasional office visits NONE of her clients would be wearing masks while she always tried her best to follow proper procedures.

I can't just walk a few blocks at 2 a.m. to get a burger. There are only a handful of supermarkets of any worth.

Even though pork is more widely available, the bacon here sucks.

"94988","comment","ehgin74","2019","but the amount of war hysteria I'm hearing from Indians around me is shocking. 

I'm Pakistani - I mean literally bleed green but my roots are in India so basically look south Indian. I mean I've often been mistaken for a mallu to the extent that people on the road have approached me and said malayalee Ile or somehting to that effect.

Was sitting in a meeting at a clients with mostly Indians and when we were done the topic somehow turned around to international politics where one of the Indians was questioned by an Arab on what the real problem is. The amount of hate spewing in that conversation shocked my eyes. Things about enough is enough. This time we won't let go and we need to teach Pakistan a lesson for eternity - I felt I was sitting with a bjp spokesperson. And then he turns around to me addresses me by name and says I mean you with your knowledge of current affairs would know more right? The look on his face when I said I'm Pakistani and while I understand his anger at what happened, what's happening right now is nothing but jingoism in an election year, and I would refrain from commenting further was PRICELESS. The Arab laughed out loud like there's no tomorrow. The Indian tried to back up but knew he'd fucked up.

He did call me back a bit later in the day and apologized quite a bit with the excuse he didn’t know I was Pakistani. I mean right that’s nice. If I wasn’t Pakistani you’d still hate us right?

The media in India (fed on lines by their government sources) has pulled a genie out of the bottle that the official government is going to have a tough time putting back in. And the public is devouring the prime time pieces like rabid dogs. 

It’s the same at the coffee shops I hang out at. Listening to the loud conversations about how they’re gonna fuck what would amount to pretty much the same people on the other side of the border gets my blood boiling but I just let it go.

We are talking about the UAE here, not Europe. Your ""premium"" cars are premium there only, our ""premium"" cars are super cars.

>driven by people who simply can't afford a BMW, Mercedes

Thats why Taxis drive your ""premium"" cars there...

>Just go to the official dealer

Again, a big part of reliability is also being cheap to fix, and the original topic ""Nissan Patrols"" meet that, thats why more people like them over other brands, not everyone is rich enough to take their car to the Stealership after their warranty runs out, so they take it to independent shops to maintain and fix","yes break toyotas nissans firstly premium brands luxury brands luxury brand models considered luxury cars save cheaper ones talking uae europe premium cars premium premium cars super cars driven people simply afford bmw mercedes taxis drive premium cars official dealer big reliability cheap fix original topic nissan patrols meet people like brands rich car stealership warranty runs independent shops maintain fix","61","['yes', 'break', 'toyota', 'nissans', 'firstly', 'premium', 'brand', 'luxury', 'brand', 'luxury', 'brand', 'model', 'consider', 'luxury', 'car', 'save', 'cheap', 'one', 'talk', 'uae', 'europe', 'premium', 'cars', 'premium', 'premium', 'car', 'super', 'car', 'drive', 'people', 'simply', 'afford', 'bmw', 'mercede', 'taxis', 'drive', 'premium', 'car', 'official', 'dealer', 'big', 'reliability', 'cheap', 'fix', 'original', 'topic', 'nissan', 'patrol', 'meet', 'people', 'like', 'brand', 'rich', 'car', 'stealership', 'warranty', 'run', 'independent', 'shop', 'maintain', 'fix']"

because I believe the better learning foundation a child has (most of the time, expensive),  the brighter the future they can have. 

Then again, with the rest of the points you have, well, it may be true... but you must understand too that each of us has a unique way of living, just let them be, if expats wanna live like a prince here in Dubai or they want to live like a pauper, it's up to them...besides, if they fail, they will learn... if they succeed, then just be happy for them.

Exactly. It would be impractical for the whole road to be stuck behind one driver, hence why the road rules require you to drive around them on the right if they refuse to move.

Yes, they are publicly traded, so are Emirates and Etihad airways. Why would they not be? The government still has a say in how these business are operated, and that is to the benefit of the country, its culture and the business itself.

Then you bring up the fact that Etisalat operated in 16 countries, which only makes the topic more obvious. You think Etisalat is filtering the content in countries other than here? No, and then ask yourself why.

The fact that you even mention the BBC (A government funded company) and trying to say anyone is comparing them to a private company like Chanel 4 just shows how badly you are grasping any understanding of a basic comment like ""Du is just Etisalat wearing a different hat""

Now you resent the fact that you have no path to citizenship. You feel like you should belong here more than others but you don't. I honestly feel for you but you need to come to term with it and get rid of the chip on your shoulder because it's not going to change anytime soon. 

As for the ""brown skin"" racism at every sauce you need to cut that out too because it is not really true.

Everywhere I go the top management is from the subcontinent. Even the CEO of Citigroup is Pakistani do you think they took him because he is cheaper than a Brit? Half of my company is Indians and Pakistanis who earn a lot more than I do, yet somehow ""wawawa there is no chance to succeed and it's because of racism..."".

Is has been frustrating, because everyone i know at home or anywhere in world is using it and calling them to other programs was frustrating. The other program, only (from gaming voice com programs) which was working was Twitch App. And guess what, today Etisalat blocked even that one. I have to ask, anyone know if something is happening or this will just be life in dubai? No voice com for gamers (casual or hardcore). This was one of the reasons i was ok with moving so far from home, and now it is gone.","discord teamspeak etc banned etisalat hello going months discord teamspeak frustrating know home world calling programs frustrating program gaming voice com programs working twitch app guess today etisalat blocked ask know happening life dubai voice com gamers casual hardcore reasons ok moving far home gone","45","['discord', 'teamspeak', 'etc', 'ban', 'etisalat', 'hello', 'go', 'month', 'discord', 'teamspeak', 'frustrating', 'know', 'home', 'world', 'call', 'program', 'frustrating', 'program', 'gaming', 'voice', 'com', 'program', 'work', 'twitch', 'app', 'guess', 'today', 'etisalat', 'block', 'ask', 'know', 'happen', 'life', 'dubai', 'voice', 'com', 'gamer', 'casual', 'hardcore', 'reason', 'ok', 'move', 'far', 'home', 'go']"

By the way, if you're going to talk to the sheikh, get a male (muslim preferably) to do so. They're more likely to be approachable that way.

Of course not. Unless you actually have skills/qualifications/experience that make you *worth* employing, companies are not just going to give you a job. They aren't charities.

This myth is usually thrown around by people bitter that Europeans tend to hold the top jobs. However they don't take into account that unless you are fairly highly qualified and have a managerial or technical position, it is generally not worth it for a European to move here - a blue collar worker would make more at home. Therefore it is mostly only more highly qualified Europeans who move here in the first place.

So if you just look at it superficially, you would get the impression that Europeans are ""handed"" better jobs when in practice it is simply self-selection - blue collar European workers have no reason to move here, unlike most blue collar workers from developing Asian/African countries who make several multiples what they would at home and therefore dominate these roles in Dubai.","edit mean rude actually happen dubai course actually skills qualifications experience worth employing companies going job charities myth usually thrown people bitter europeans tend hold jobs account fairly highly qualified managerial technical position generally worth european blue collar worker home highly qualified europeans place look superficially impression europeans handed better jobs practice simply self selection blue collar european workers reason unlike blue collar workers developing asian african countries multiples home dominate roles dubai","73","['edit', 'mean', 'rude', 'actually', 'happen', 'dubai', 'course', 'actually', 'skill', 'qualification', 'experience', 'worth', 'employ', 'company', 'go', 'job', 'charity', 'myth', 'usually', 'throw', 'people', 'bitter', 'european', 'tend', 'hold', 'job', 'account', 'fairly', 'highly', 'qualified', 'managerial', 'technical', 'position', 'generally', 'worth', 'european', 'blue', 'collar', 'worker', 'home', 'highly', 'qualified', 'europeans', 'place', 'look', 'superficially', 'impression', 'european', 'hand', 'well', 'job', 'practice', 'simply', 'self', 'selection', 'blue', 'collar', 'european', 'worker', 'reason', 'unlike', 'blue', 'collar', 'worker', 'develop', 'asian', 'african', 'country', 'multiples', 'home', 'dominate', 'role', 'dubai']"

However, to continue on with your points, note that if you're paying rent in Dubai, please don't victimise yourself as a peasant scraping on savings, you're much better than the ones staying in labor accommodations sending money back home to their families. Also, compensations from your employers aren't to be confused with savings from your expenses.

I believe UAE is a place where you get to decide what luxuries are your priorities. A person earning 7k can decide for themselves whether they want to have a car, a good place, fancy food/clothing or be really stringent to save up for down-payment to own a property.

At the end of the day, there was a surge of residents moving from economical Emirate, like Sharjah and Ajman, to Dubai during covid due to drop in rents and now that the rents are getting back, just like inflation of prices in other amenities, we would like to find fairness. 

100% sure this comment will be down voted.","apologies question comparing fairness aspect tangent gets compensation completely agree law regulation rent comment come mortgage rates regulated continue points note paying rent dubai victimise peasant scraping savings better ones staying labor accommodations sending money home families compensations employers confused savings expenses believe uae place decide luxuries priorities person earning 7k decide want car good place fancy food clothing stringent save payment property end day surge residents moving economical emirate like sharjah ajman dubai covid drop rents rents getting like inflation prices amenities like find fairness 100 sure comment voted","90","['apology', 'question', 'compare', 'fairness', 'aspect', 'tangent', 'get', 'compensation', 'completely', 'agree', 'law', 'regulation', 'rent', 'comment', 'come', 'mortgage', 'rate', 'regulate', 'continue', 'point', 'note', 'pay', 'rent', 'dubai', 'victimise', 'peasant', 'scrape', 'saving', 'well', 'one', 'stay', 'labor', 'accommodation', 'send', 'money', 'home', 'family', 'compensation', 'employer', 'confused', 'saving', 'expense', 'believe', 'uae', 'place', 'decide', 'luxury', 'priority', 'person', 'earn', '7k', 'decide', 'want', 'car', 'good', 'place', 'fancy', 'food', 'clothing', 'stringent', 'save', 'payment', 'property', 'end', 'day', 'surge', 'resident', 'move', 'economical', 'emirate', 'like', 'sharjah', 'ajman', 'dubai', 'covid', 'drop', 'rent', 'rent', 'get', 'like', 'inflation', 'price', 'amenity', 'like', 'find', 'fairness', '100', 'sure', 'comment', 'vote']"
