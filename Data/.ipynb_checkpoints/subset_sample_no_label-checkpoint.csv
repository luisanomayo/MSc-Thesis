I can't just walk a few blocks at 2 a.m. to get a burger. There are only a handful of supermarkets of any worth. We have to deal with monsoons, roaming cows and their waste, tons of stray dogs, and around 10,000 different species of arachnids and insects. There's the ""taxi mafia"", woeful customer service, rude shopkeepers who act like they're doing you a favor, and frequent power cuts that are just accepted as normal. Even though pork is more widely available, the bacon here sucks. 

I'm not saying Goa is a hell-hole, and there are some positives (such as cheaper internet), but when you're used to a certain lifestyle and have to completely leave it all behind for a less-developed place you have pretty much zero attachment to, it's jarring.","describe feeling perfectly force permanent having difficult adjust walk block burger handful supermarket deal roam cow waste ton stray dog specie insect taxi mafia customer service rude shopkeeper favor frequent power pork widely bacon hole positive cheap internet lifestyle developed zero attachment","['describe', 'feeling', 'perfectly', 'force', 'permanent', 'having', 'difficult', 'adjust', 'walk', 'block', 'burger', 'handful', 'supermarket', 'deal', 'roam', 'cow', 'waste', 'ton', 'stray', 'dog', 'specie', 'insect', 'taxi', 'mafia', 'customer', 'service', 'rude', 'shopkeeper', 'favor', 'frequent', 'power', 'pork', 'widely', 'bacon', 'hole', 'positive', 'cheap', 'internet', 'lifestyle', 'developed', 'zero', 'attachment']","42"

This is not justified but he better only use fairt rade electronics. Not to mention food and staples like coffee. Second, the UAE never invaded anyone. Third, it's a city where roughly 3.5million people decided to come to for a better life. It's the NYC of the Arab world and Middle East. Indians, Pakistanis, Bengalis, Filipinos, Russians, Western Europeans, Brits, Africans, Aussies, Chinese and so on have all come here. Without Dubai people would have settled for much less.

I came to Dubai in the early 90s. Etisalat, as I told one of its staff last week, was one of the most cutting edge companies in the  region. They were sending printed newsletters, called Tawasul, to my PO Box  about something called the Internets, they installed my land line the next day with my preferred number that I chose after flipping several sheets of numbers. That same week there was a news report from Egypt that a man died of a heart attack because of the sudden joy to learn that he won the telephone lottery, he was selected to have a phone line and a number instead of the usual 10 year waiting list. A British dude started an audio service to read your astrological sign, 10 AED per call, he made a killing, with every bored secretary or call center staff trying their luck daily, 
until a complaint caused his operation to close, it was a romantic note that caused the complaint.
Then George Clooney and his gang came to shoot Syriana movie, and the rest is mystery.","planning oil revenue coastal minded magazine duty horse racing advert etisalat staff edge region print box internet instal land line preferred flip sheet egypt die heart attack sudden joy win telephone lottery select line usual waiting british audio service sign killing bored center staff complaint operation romantic note complaint george gang shoot movie rest mystery","['planning', 'oil', 'revenue', 'coastal', 'minded', 'magazine', 'duty', 'horse', 'racing', 'advert', 'etisalat', 'staff', 'edge', 'region', 'print', 'box', 'internet', 'instal', 'land', 'line', 'preferred', 'flip', 'sheet', 'egypt', 'die', 'heart', 'attack', 'sudden', 'joy', 'win', 'telephone', 'lottery', 'select', 'line', 'usual', 'waiting', 'british', 'audio', 'service', 'sign', 'killing', 'bored', 'center', 'staff', 'complaint', 'operation', 'romantic', 'note', 'complaint', 'george', 'gang', 'shoot', 'movie', 'rest', 'mystery']","55"

I can understand that maybe they didn't really understand it or think about it themselves. 

Now you resent the fact that you have no path to citizenship. You feel like you should belong here more than others but you don't. I honestly feel for you but you need to come to term with it and get rid of the chip on your shoulder because it's not going to change anytime soon. 

As for the ""brown skin"" racism at every sauce you need to cut that out too because it is not really true.

Everywhere I go the top management is from the subcontinent. Even the CEO of Citigroup is Pakistani do you think they took him because he is cheaper than a Brit? Half of my company is Indians and Pakistanis who earn a lot more than I do, yet somehow ""wawawa there is no chance to succeed and it's because of racism..."".  Then how did all those ""brown guys"" make it everywhere in Dubai?

You have employment rights. They are indicated in your contract. They are not fantastic really but they are better than in some other places. 

And what do your manager have to do with tax?? You're barely coherent at this point.

Also, compensations from your employers aren't to be confused with savings from your expenses.

I believe UAE is a place where you get to decide what luxuries are your priorities. A person earning 7k can decide for themselves whether they want to have a car, a good place, fancy food/clothing or be really stringent to save up for down-payment to own a property.

At the end of the day, there was a surge of residents moving from economical Emirate, like Sharjah and Ajman, to Dubai during covid due to drop in rents and now that the rents are getting back, just like inflation of prices in other amenities, we would like to find fairness. 

100% sure this comment will be down voted.","apology fairness aspect compensation law regulation rent mortgage regulate note rent peasant scrape saving labor accommodation family compensation employer confuse saving expense luxury priority earn fancy food clothing stringent payment property surge resident economical ajman covid rent rent inflation price amenity fairness","['apology', 'fairness', 'aspect', 'compensation', 'law', 'regulation', 'rent', 'mortgage', 'regulate', 'note', 'rent', 'peasant', 'scrape', 'saving', 'labor', 'accommodation', 'family', 'compensation', 'employer', 'confuse', 'saving', 'expense', 'luxury', 'priority', 'earn', 'fancy', 'food', 'clothing', 'stringent', 'payment', 'property', 'surge', 'resident', 'economical', 'ajman', 'covid', 'rent', 'rent', 'inflation', 'price', 'amenity', 'fairness']","42"

Why not? since it is for the benefit of women and also it is their demand. You have specially positioned parking and metro cabins in Dubai for example. It is not ""Women only"". But ""All parking are available for everyone, and an additional (for women only) parking is also provided to ensure safety, ease and better quality of life.

Women parking are usually closer to the facility so they don't have to walk a lot in the middle of the heat, let alone the children that she take care of. That's one of many blesses of the UAE mother, an active member of society...

In the UAE, as a man, we give more respect and effort to our women. We believe that we are to complement each other, rather than competing for pathetic advantages. It is an act of manhood, nobility, and magnanimity...","realistic address benefit demand specially position parking metro cabin parking additional parking ensure safety ease parking facility walk middle heat child mother active member society respect effort compete pathetic advantage","['realistic', 'address', 'benefit', 'demand', 'specially', 'position', 'parking', 'metro', 'cabin', 'parking', 'additional', 'parking', 'ensure', 'safety', 'ease', 'parking', 'facility', 'walk', 'middle', 'heat', 'child', 'mother', 'active', 'member', 'society', 'respect', 'effort', 'compete', 'pathetic', 'advantage']","30"

I'm from India and studied there.

I've looked at MNCs that claim to be equal opportunity but insist on western degrees/pedigree.

I don't care where someone is educated, I dropped out of university but still did pretty well in my career through hard work.
However I've interviewed some people with 2 degrees who could hardly answer a few basic questions when asked.

To me job based knowledge, work ethic, communication skills, general writing skills, critical thinking, initiative, ability to take constructive critiscm, ownership, English language skills are all really important for me and the companies I've worked for.

It's difficult to explain without sounding prejudiced but certain ways of working I've seen from individuals from certain countries are not really compatible with the corporate culture of some businesses. 

As an example, where I'm from it is considered acceptable to challenge your boss on why decisions are made,  to acknowledge mistakes and accept responsibility, to say no to work when you think it can't be done or don't have time.  With a lot of Indian colleagues I've worked with, they would say that those sorts of things would be unacceptable in their work culture.  

I hope you take that in the way it was meant.  Just that in my experience as a Westerner, it can be difficult trying to adapt to Indian workplace culture and I'm sure the same true in reverse.  Whether this is an issue or not depends on the individual and the business involved.   This may in turn affect peoples hiring decisions.","degree workplace educate university career interview degree hardly ethic communication skill writing skill critical thinking initiative constructive ownership language skill difficult explain prejudiced individual compatible corporate culture acceptable challenge boss decision acknowledge responsibility indian colleague unacceptable culture westerner difficult adapt indian workplace culture reverse individual turn hire decision","['degree', 'workplace', 'educate', 'university', 'career', 'interview', 'degree', 'hardly', 'ethic', 'communication', 'skill', 'writing', 'skill', 'critical', 'thinking', 'initiative', 'constructive', 'ownership', 'language', 'skill', 'difficult', 'explain', 'prejudiced', 'individual', 'compatible', 'corporate', 'culture', 'acceptable', 'challenge', 'boss', 'decision', 'acknowledge', 'responsibility', 'indian', 'colleague', 'unacceptable', 'culture', 'westerner', 'difficult', 'adapt', 'indian', 'workplace', 'culture', 'reverse', 'individual', 'turn', 'hire', 'decision']","48"

Especially who are in here for expo, and could very much well be interested in living in Dubai/UAE because of the response to Covid here.

But on the other hand, what after expo? I don't think there will be any other reason or directive to keep increasing the rental prices or even the property prices. Once the extra people leave - all those who are employed at expo/just visiting expo and then when the tourist season is also over. What after that? Most likely we will see late 2020s prices again or even lower.

Obviously, if someone has a better perspective, I am all ears.","purely broker landlord artificially drive demand hike price trend real estate market expo covid expo rental price property price employ expo visit expo tourist season late price perspective ear","['purely', 'broker', 'landlord', 'artificially', 'drive', 'demand', 'hike', 'price', 'trend', 'real', 'estate', 'market', 'expo', 'covid', 'expo', 'rental', 'price', 'property', 'price', 'employ', 'expo', 'visit', 'expo', 'tourist', 'season', 'late', 'price', 'perspective', 'ear']","29"

Of course not. Unless you actually have skills/qualifications/experience that make you *worth* employing, companies are not just going to give you a job. They aren't charities.

This myth is usually thrown around by people bitter that Europeans tend to hold the top jobs. However they don't take into account that unless you are fairly highly qualified and have a managerial or technical position, it is generally not worth it for a European to move here - a blue collar worker would make more at home. Therefore it is mostly only more highly qualified Europeans who move here in the first place.

So if you just look at it superficially, you would get the impression that Europeans are ""handed"" better jobs when in practice it is simply self-selection - blue collar European workers have no reason to move here, unlike most blue collar workers from developing Asian/African countries who make several multiples what they would at home and therefore dominate these roles in Dubai.","rude skill qualification employ charity myth bitter europeans tend fairly highly qualified managerial technical position european blue collar worker highly qualified european impression european practice selection blue collar european worker unlike blue collar worker develop asian african dominate role","['rude', 'skill', 'qualification', 'employ', 'charity', 'myth', 'bitter', 'europeans', 'tend', 'fairly', 'highly', 'qualified', 'managerial', 'technical', 'position', 'european', 'blue', 'collar', 'worker', 'highly', 'qualified', 'european', 'impression', 'european', 'practice', 'selection', 'blue', 'collar', 'european', 'worker', 'unlike', 'blue', 'collar', 'worker', 'develop', 'asian', 'african', 'dominate', 'role']","39"

Not all interviewing managers know what questions to ask (remember, you may be the exception as a hiring manager).

Secondly, as I've witnessed in over a decade of working in the UAE, expats do their utmost to recreate their national networks in the UAE - mostly at work. This is why you will find groups (or gangs as I like to call them) of Indians, Filipinos, Westerners (oh yes!) looking after ""our own"".

I recommend the Barka souq and Nizwa Souq (Mutrah Souq is mostly aimed at tourists, so go there only if you need souvenirs), the Sultan Qaboos Mosque, the Fort of Al-Hazm (and maybe the Nakhl Fort, which was closed for renovation when we went), and the Hot Springs in Ar-Rustaq and Nakhl.

The five hundred Euros per person we spent on three days in Dubai (incl. two nights in Sharjah, 1000km drive, traffic jams, international insurance for our Omani rental and entrance fee for Burj Khalifa) were my most regretted spending. In retrospect, we really should have split the three days into one day splashing about at Wadi Shab, one more visit to the Nakhl hot springs , and one in the Jebel Shams, going the Balcony Walk again. That would have been so much more relaxing than Dubai.","fake destination area souq souq souq aim tourist sultan mosque fort fort renovation hot spring euro spend night drive traffic jam international insurance omani rental entrance fee burj khalifa spending retrospect split splash wadi visit hot spring jebel sham balcony walk relaxing","['fake', 'destination', 'area', 'souq', 'souq', 'souq', 'aim', 'tourist', 'sultan', 'mosque', 'fort', 'fort', 'renovation', 'hot', 'spring', 'euro', 'spend', 'night', 'drive', 'traffic', 'jam', 'international', 'insurance', 'omani', 'rental', 'entrance', 'fee', 'burj', 'khalifa', 'spending', 'retrospect', 'split', 'splash', 'wadi', 'visit', 'hot', 'spring', 'jebel', 'sham', 'balcony', 'walk', 'relaxing']","42"

I went for an interview at a Dubai based law firm full of Indian lawyers run by a well known Indian lawyer - they said they would love to have a British lawyer as it would be good for the firms reputation, but could hire around 10 Indian lawyers for the same cost, so they couldn‚Äôt justify hiring me‚Ä¶.  I don‚Äôt know if that means the Indian lawyers are making more money here than they would in India, or whether there‚Äôs some other benefit which means they prefer it here. It also means the job market is skewed slightly as many business owners are taking full advantage of this and will only hire Indian qualified people because they can get away with paying them less. I‚Äôve seen it in family offices and also in the medical profession too.

Business owners take advantage of the situation and I‚Äôm sorry to say even if you quit or turn down a job, they will easily find a replacement. Its a terrible market.

I can only advise that you try to work for a smaller company and make yourself as indispensable as possible and keep trying to negotiate a higher salary‚Ä¶","indian lawyer underpaid role western lawyer solution interview law firm indian lawyer indian lawyer british lawyer firm reputation hire indian lawyer cost justify hire indian lawyer india benefit market slightly advantage hire indian qualified family office medical profession advantage quit turn replacement terrible market advise negotiate salary","['indian', 'lawyer', 'underpaid', 'role', 'western', 'lawyer', 'solution', 'interview', 'law', 'firm', 'indian', 'lawyer', 'indian', 'lawyer', 'british', 'lawyer', 'firm', 'reputation', 'hire', 'indian', 'lawyer', 'cost', 'justify', 'hire', 'indian', 'lawyer', 'india', 'benefit', 'market', 'slightly', 'advantage', 'hire', 'indian', 'qualified', 'family', 'office', 'medical', 'profession', 'advantage', 'quit', 'turn', 'replacement', 'terrible', 'market', 'advise', 'negotiate', 'salary']","47"

Will a person from a third world country accept a lower salary in comparison to someone from the west? Yes. But that's missing the point.
The point is equal pay for equal work.

I'd suggest you move to a company which doesn't pay people based on where they're from but rather for the quality of their work.

I've never had to do this before in the years that I've been flying Emirates, and it's really disappointing. I absolutely hate waiting at baggage carousels for my bag, hence I always pack light for my trips, but now enforcing a total carry-on weight of 7kg just adds even more delays when you're at the airport.

"82392","comment","iarfwgl","2022-06-01 11:43:43","2022","This post reminds me of an incident- I used to stay on the mezzanine floor with a big balcony- - generally people in the upper floor were considerate and would not throw crap into my balcony-as the design was such that my balcony was of the bigger width than theirs!!

But the lady in the top floor right above me , would constantly throw her pet fur by dusting her pet bed and carpet on the balcony- -since I wasn‚Äôt using it other than drying clothes , I did not think much of it!!

One morning we decided to eat breakfast out- and we arrange and just sit and she can definitely see us from her angle  still decides to dust pet fur filled carpet right into us!- I called out to her and she just off handedly said ok and went off inside!!! No apologies!!!

And I think one day her very very expensive pet carpet fell into my balcony,, I just left it there hoping she would come get it! -she did not and it kept lying there for a couple of days- I just put it to the corner!!! More visible to her... after another few days another expensive carpet- I did not pick it -since I work almost 12 hrs a day plus travel- I am in the house for limited hour‚Äôs,,so I guess even if she did come to pick it - I did not knw , nor did she leave a note!

Then one afternoon  someone banged on my door - we just sat for lunch- we eat food on floor in a very traditional Asian way- so I told her to come back later and pick it !!! She made a big fuss and and screamed loudly( racial slur included-becse I‚Äôm brown and she is a privileged white) - I refused to let her in side the house and  she threatened to call the cops on me!!!! Saying I stole her expensive carpets !!!

I laughed at her breakdown and said sure - call the cops and closed the door!!  

She banged many times on my door ,, I have Chinese -Arabic neighbors who came out and everyone watching!!!

Afterwards one of  her friend comes and knocks my door and very politely apologize for her friend - I refused to accept her apology and said her friend need to apologize- but friend wouldn‚Äôt come to do that!!!  Her friend  started a story about how covid pressure and loss of job made her behave like that!!! 

I did not accept the apology and told her friend call the cops!!! 

I left for my duty and a couple of days later the neighbors told me she had to vacate cause of unable to meet rent!!!

But imagine threatening me with calling cops  for two carpets she dropped and refused to pick up and over time both completely covered by fur she kept throwing her pet fur down!!

Karma works in its own ways!

Not all neighbors I have had over the years behaved like this- most were generally nice and cordial!!

But some really make us think about how the Karen‚Äôs need to be given their own meds!!

After that I have never again stayed on mez floors as I don‚Äôt want such things to repeat and now love the higher floors!

When the left lane is blocked by a slow driver. 

> isn't it the only reason you need to overtake from the right is when somebody is blocking you and you can't overtake from the left?

Exactly. It would be impractical for the whole road to be stuck behind one driver, hence why the road rules require you to drive around them on the right if they refuse to move.

> anyway, be my guest, overtake from the right. i think you are bold enough to risk fines.

There are no fines in that situation, it's the correct procedure.","ordinary overtake left lane block driver overtake somebody block overtake left impractical road driver road rule drive refuse guest overtake bold risk fine fine procedure","['ordinary', 'overtake', 'left', 'lane', 'block', 'driver', 'overtake', 'somebody', 'block', 'overtake', 'left', 'impractical', 'road', 'driver', 'road', 'rule', 'drive', 'refuse', 'guest', 'overtake', 'bold', 'risk', 'fine', 'fine', 'procedure']","25"

Etisalat is a semi government company, as is Du. So they control the content. Hense Du also blocking Skype, which was the topic at hand. 

Yes, they are publicly traded, so are Emirates and Etihad airways. Why would they not be? The government still has a say in how these business are operated, and that is to the benefit of the country, its culture and the business itself.

Then you bring up the fact that Etisalat operated in 16 countries, which only makes the topic more obvious. You think Etisalat is filtering the content in countries other than here? No, and then ask yourself why.

The fact that you even mention the BBC (A government funded company) and trying to say anyone is comparing them to a private company like Chanel 4 just shows how badly you are grasping any understanding of a basic comment like ""Du is just Etisalat wearing a different hat""

You can read, copy and paste from wiki; well done.

"121299","comment","ehgin74","2019-02-28 10:33:30","2019","but the amount of war hysteria I'm hearing from Indians around me is shocking. 

I'm Pakistani - I mean literally bleed green but my roots are in India so basically look south Indian. I mean I've often been mistaken for a mallu to the extent that people on the road have approached me and said malayalee Ile or somehting to that effect.

Was sitting in a meeting at a clients with mostly Indians and when we were done the topic somehow turned around to international politics where one of the Indians was questioned by an Arab on what the real problem is. The amount of hate spewing in that conversation shocked my eyes. Things about enough is enough. This time we won't let go and we need to teach Pakistan a lesson for eternity - I felt I was sitting with a bjp spokesperson. And then he turns around to me addresses me by name and says I mean you with your knowledge of current affairs would know more right? The look on his face when I said I'm Pakistani and while I understand his anger at what happened, what's happening right now is nothing but jingoism in an election year, and I would refrain from commenting further was PRICELESS. The Arab laughed out loud like there's no tomorrow. The Indian tried to back up but knew he'd fucked up.

He did call me back a bit later in the day and apologized quite a bit with the excuse he didn‚Äôt know I was Pakistani. I mean right that‚Äôs nice. If I wasn‚Äôt Pakistani you‚Äôd still hate us right?

The media in India (fed on lines by their government sources) has pulled a genie out of the bottle that the official government is going to have a tough time putting back in. And the public is devouring the prime time pieces like rabid dogs. 

It‚Äôs the same at the coffee shops I hang out at. Listening to the loud conversations about how they‚Äôre gonna fuck what would amount to pretty much the same people on the other side of the border gets my blood boiling but I just let it go.

I'm a 21 year old girl with a European passport who's come back to Dubai after 5 years to live with my parents. I earned my high school diploma here and went on to the UK to do one year of college. I've realised that studying is just not for me due to my medical issues. I may go back to it in the future, but as for now, I just want to get a job.

I have no friends here to help me so I'm clueless as to how to get a job. I would like to start out with temporary promotional/modelling jobs but I have no idea where to look for one. Relatives have told me there are a lot of scams so I'm not sure what I should avoid and can't find any proper guide. I'm game for anything but I have no idea what to do.

I'm looking for really simple starter jobs to pretty up my resume.
