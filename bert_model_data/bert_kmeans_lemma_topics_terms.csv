I think we should be more grateful . let I tell you why . I 've live in a bunch of place . almost ten different country , if you can believe it . but it be only here in Dubai that I be not scared to leave my car or apartment open . US / EU ? forget about it . that say something . the Emiratis be so welcoming and friendly . I mean , I 've have so many cup of arabic coffee or karak and share so many meal with local here , it be crazy . they be so hospitable to I , it be like they want to make you feel at home . there be no tax . zero . and I can run my company just the way I want . I can make decision , I make money , and not worry about the government tell I what to do and take 60 % of the revenue . I 've build a successful business here . I honestly do not think I could have do the same in Western Europe . be the place expensive ? sure , but you do not have to spend your money on luxury option , if you do not want to . it be your choice . no place be perfect . every country have its good and bad side . but we need to remember the good stuff too . I think I would go far and say that we should focus on the good stuff . we need to be extremely thankful for the freedom and safety we have here . peace out , enjoy your karak :)"", 'I will preface this by say , "" individual mile will vary . "" as clich√© as it sound , it be really be what it be . I may be have a grand time as a UAE expat , but even with my exact situation you , and your family may not . if you be confused in what be the good decision to make , the internet will not make it any easy , because , see my clich√© statement , lol . I think it be good to find out , with this move , what be the most important to you . be it the money ? be it the ability to get citizenship in another country ? because , that be exactly what your scenario read to to I , but I do not know which be more important to you . ok , I be make the wrong comment on the wrong post , lol . so , the actual cost of schooling in Dubai be : with tuition , arbitrary fee , uniform ( for regular and PE , sock , shoe sweater , it be amazing the thing that encompass "" uniform "" ) , book and supply ( and supply not mention initially but might be need throughout the school year ) , the bus , because the bus be often not include , extra curricular activity , because this be often not include , and just throw in extra thing for a financial security blanket , while live in Marina , yeah , I do not see you pay less than 20k AED , but understand , this be just the starting point , it can more than quadruple in cost per year . for education , you can check out [ this webpage ] ( it give you a lot to consider . life be multi dimensional , always include fine when factor in monthly cost . thing will break , or inconvenience you at the most inopportune time , you can not predict these thing . honestly , Dubai have a high cost of live for most , you will have regular run of the mill bill that you will have everywhere , and some of it depend on your usage , such as water , electricity , gas , etc . for internet , phone , tv , there be du and there be etisalat , just Google they in Dubai , their website have a lot of information . for cellphone , there be those mention and virgin mobile , I be not sure there be other provider . Virgin mobile also have a website for Dubai . bullying be EVERYWHERE , everywhere , and teach your child how to defend themselves against it will be an ongoing thing , but that would be a factor even if you stay home , like the person before I say , some kid get bully , some kid do not , luck of the draw I guess . I agree that you should teach your child to not be a bully , ignorant or intolerant ( already have enough of that in Dubai ) , I think this be very important . I think your child will feel so much more at home in Dubai than they would in Eindhoven , but what do I know ? individual adapt individually . I will say though , Dubai have a large indian community , so you will meet plenty everywhere you go , include school . but , that do not mean Indians do not face their own problem in the Emirate , or country . everything else you \'ve ask would be at the mercy of your employer , I think anyway . just remember , a golden visa be not permanent residency or citizenship , and you seem quite interested in those . the golden visa just hold you over long than the standard , but I truly do not see it as anything special , it still do not give you any root in the country , that be my opinion anyway . HR say you will not have to work outside of work hour ... ok ! lol , take that at face value , most of the people I know have to , but there be some who do not , so I hope you will fall into the latter , though few they be . yeah , work life balance be pretty non existent in Dubai , on a whole . if I be you , I would look at move to another country as move to another part of India , ( of course the obvious aside ) , where you do not have any family or friend . it be go to be a big change for all of you , sometimes change be just necessary , sometimes change be just desire . anyway , good luck with whatever you decide ! I wish for you and your family will be abundantly happy with the choice ! also , dumb question , feel free to ignore , why be your job quote everything in usd , do they really plan on pay you in usd ? you literally can not spend usd in the UAE , so you would have to exchange before on you can use your paycheck . the UAE do have a lock exchange rate with usd , so no sliding . also , be the 10k usd a month inclusive of housing and transport , or would they pay those out differently ? because if it be just 10k flat usd per month , baby , that be not much in term of Dubai lifestyle ... üòê but you do mention bonus , and I can not remember what that part say , lol . keep in mind that you will be pay more , number wise , in another country vs India , but what exactly do that mean in term of actually live somewhere ? it sound like a lot , but it may work out to the exact same . anyway , feel free to ignore that last part , because you be obviously try to figure that part out .']"

I meet both the owner and they assure I we would get x4 the sale as we usually would as the the total cost for everything regard marketing and advertising be 100,000 for 2 month . I say that would be great , but I will not have sufficient stock . even if I place an order a week into the marketing and advertising I will not have enough product for the new customer , so I ask they if we could start small , they say it would be well to launch big and if the demand be much it will be similar to supreme where there be not enough product to meet demand , I be already go to place an order for product \'s so I decide to double the total order . everything start out great , ton of influencer post about it drive up my Instagram follower from 10k to 150k in less than a week . no sale , ton of traffic on the website , I be happy even if they do not x4 the sale , simply x2 the sale and I would \'ve be overjoy , what end up happen be my customer base got alienate I believe and I be get no return or organic customer , I go from on average 500 sale a month to below 50 . I ask some of my customer who use to order plenty from I , apparently they have not see a single ad from my company , they usually get remind by they to pick up a few thing every month . also all 3 company have get together and decide to ghost I on all platform . TLDR : I end up invest 400,000 with agency / company and stock up my product , which essentially have to all be change due cease and desist + I lose my exist clientele due to the marketing company alienate they and never reach they through ad .
