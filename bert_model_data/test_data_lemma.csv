Of course not. Unless you actually have skills/qualifications/experience that make you *worth* employing, companies are not just going to give you a job. They aren't charities.

This myth is usually thrown around by people bitter that Europeans tend to hold the top jobs. However they don't take into account that unless you are fairly highly qualified and have a managerial or technical position, it is generally not worth it for a European to move here - a blue collar worker would make more at home. Therefore it is mostly only more highly qualified Europeans who move here in the first place.

So if you just look at it superficially, you would get the impression that Europeans are ""handed"" better jobs when in practice it is simply self-selection - blue collar European workers have no reason to move here, unlike most blue collar workers from developing Asian/African countries who make several multiples what they would at home and therefore dominate these roles in Dubai.","> Edit : I do not mean to be rude , but do not that actually happen in Dubai ?    of course not . unless you actually have skill / qualification / experience that make you * worth * employ , company be not just go to give you a job . they be not charity .   this myth be usually throw around by people bitter that Europeans tend to hold the top job . however they do not take into account that unless you be fairly highly qualified and have a managerial or technical position , it be generally not worth it for a European to move here - a blue collar worker would make more at home . therefore it be mostly only more highly qualified Europeans who move here in the first place .   so if you just look at it superficially , you would get the impression that Europeans be "" handed "" well job when in practice it be simply self - selection - blue collar european worker have no reason to move here , unlike most blue collar worker from develop asian / african country who make several multiple what they would at home and therefore dominate these role in Dubai ."

To me job based knowledge, work ethic, communication skills, general writing skills, critical thinking, initiative, ability to take constructive critiscm, ownership, English language skills are all really important for me and the companies I've worked for.

It's difficult to explain without sounding prejudiced but certain ways of working I've seen from individuals from certain countries are not really compatible with the corporate culture of some businesses. 

As an example, where I'm from it is considered acceptable to challenge your boss on why decisions are made,  to acknowledge mistakes and accept responsibility, to say no to work when you think it can't be done or don't have time.  With a lot of Indian colleagues I've worked with, they would say that those sorts of things would be unacceptable in their work culture.  

I hope you take that in the way it was meant.  Just that in my experience as a Westerner, it can be difficult trying to adapt to Indian workplace culture and I'm sure the same true in reverse.  Whether this is an issue or not depends on the individual and the business involved.   This may in turn affect peoples hiring decisions.","degree only get you so far , experience be far more important after 2 - 3 year in the workplace .

Locals are masters of prostitutions :P And prostitution in the UAE isn't exactly subtle.

When the left lane is blocked by a slow driver. 

> isn't it the only reason you need to overtake from the right is when somebody is blocking you and you can't overtake from the left?

Exactly. It would be impractical for the whole road to be stuck behind one driver, hence why the road rules require you to drive around them on the right if they refuse to move.

504,comment,ehgin74,2019-02-28 10:33:30,2019,"but the amount of war hysteria I'm hearing from Indians around me is shocking. 

I'm Pakistani - I mean literally bleed green but my roots are in India so basically look south Indian. I mean I've often been mistaken for a mallu to the extent that people on the road have approached me and said malayalee Ile or somehting to that effect.

Was sitting in a meeting at a clients with mostly Indians and when we were done the topic somehow turned around to international politics where one of the Indians was questioned by an Arab on what the real problem is. The amount of hate spewing in that conversation shocked my eyes. Things about enough is enough. This time we won't let go and we need to teach Pakistan a lesson for eternity - I felt I was sitting with a bjp spokesperson. And then he turns around to me addresses me by name and says I mean you with your knowledge of current affairs would know more right? The look on his face when I said I'm Pakistani and while I understand his anger at what happened, what's happening right now is nothing but jingoism in an election year, and I would refrain from commenting further was PRICELESS. The Arab laughed out loud like there's no tomorrow. The Indian tried to back up but knew he'd fucked up.

He did call me back a bit later in the day and apologized quite a bit with the excuse he didn’t know I was Pakistani. I mean right that’s nice. If I wasn’t Pakistani you’d still hate us right?

The media in India (fed on lines by their government sources) has pulled a genie out of the bottle that the official government is going to have a tough time putting back in. And the public is devouring the prime time pieces like rabid dogs. 

It’s the same at the coffee shops I hang out at. Listening to the loud conversations about how they’re gonna fuck what would amount to pretty much the same people on the other side of the border gets my blood boiling but I just let it go.

And someone who has FOMO could very well get into the idea of not missing out, see the upward trend and try and get in to the real estate market now. Especially who are in here for expo, and could very much well be interested in living in Dubai/UAE because of the response to Covid here.

But on the other hand, what after expo? I don't think there will be any other reason or directive to keep increasing the rental prices or even the property prices. Once the extra people leave - all those who are employed at expo/just visiting expo and then when the tourist season is also over. What after that? Most likely we will see late 2020s prices again or even lower.

Obviously, if someone has a better perspective, I am all ears.","purely just my opinion - broker / landlord try to artificially drive up the demand by hike the price . and someone who have fomo could very well get into the idea of not miss out , see the upward trend and try and get in to the real estate market now . especially who be in here for expo , and could very much well be interested in live in Dubai / UAE because of the response to Covid here .   but on the other hand , what after expo ?

Looking for one or two roommate(s) to live with in International City Phase 1 in Studio/Masterbed. 

Monthly rent here is much cheaper max 2500/month. And studio and master apartments are way better and spacious than those claustrophobic bed spaces 🤮

Cost will be 1000-1200 per month in a spacious room, which is very good imo. We will try to look for one which includes all bills. We have to search there for studios/master beds. 

I don't mind a person of any ethnicity/religion. But the roommate should be trustable. This is the most important thing for me.

Please let me know. I have to shift before 1st of June","look for a roommate to live with in International City Phase 1 Hi , guy .

945,comment,iarfwgl,2022-06-01 11:43:43,2022,"This post reminds me of an incident- I used to stay on the mezzanine floor with a big balcony- - generally people in the upper floor were considerate and would not throw crap into my balcony-as the design was such that my balcony was of the bigger width than theirs!!

But the lady in the top floor right above me , would constantly throw her pet fur by dusting her pet bed and carpet on the balcony- -since I wasn’t using it other than drying clothes , I did not think much of it!!

One morning we decided to eat breakfast out- and we arrange and just sit and she can definitely see us from her angle  still decides to dust pet fur filled carpet right into us!- I called out to her and she just off handedly said ok and went off inside!!! No apologies!!!

And I think one day her very very expensive pet carpet fell into my balcony,, I just left it there hoping she would come get it! -she did not and it kept lying there for a couple of days- I just put it to the corner!!! More visible to her... after another few days another expensive carpet- I did not pick it -since I work almost 12 hrs a day plus travel- I am in the house for limited hour’s,,so I guess even if she did come to pick it - I did not knw , nor did she leave a note!

Then one afternoon  someone banged on my door - we just sat for lunch- we eat food on floor in a very traditional Asian way- so I told her to come back later and pick it !!! She made a big fuss and and screamed loudly( racial slur included-becse I’m brown and she is a privileged white) - I refused to let her in side the house and  she threatened to call the cops on me!!!! Saying I stole her expensive carpets !!!

I laughed at her breakdown and said sure - call the cops and closed the door!!  

She banged many times on my door ,, I have Chinese -Arabic neighbors who came out and everyone watching!!!

Afterwards one of  her friend comes and knocks my door and very politely apologize for her friend - I refused to accept her apology and said her friend need to apologize- but friend wouldn’t come to do that!!!  Her friend  started a story about how covid pressure and loss of job made her behave like that!!! 

I did not accept the apology and told her friend call the cops!!! 

I left for my duty and a couple of days later the neighbors told me she had to vacate cause of unable to meet rent!!!

But imagine threatening me with calling cops  for two carpets she dropped and refused to pick up and over time both completely covered by fur she kept throwing her pet fur down!!

Karma works in its own ways!

Not all neighbors I have had over the years behaved like this- most were generally nice and cordial!!

But some really make us think about how the Karen’s need to be given their own meds!!

After that I have never again stayed on mez floors as I don’t want such things to repeat and now love the higher floors!

Long reply!!!

I'd suggest you move to a company which doesn't pay people based on where they're from but rather for the quality of their work. Or do as I did and move out of Dubai to a country where discrimination like this isn't tolerated.",first off - this be discriminatory and should be a crime . as it be in many other nation . ignore the apologist who say otherwise .   will a person from a third world country accept a low salary in comparison to someone from the west ? yes . but that be miss the point . the point be equal pay for equal work .   I would suggest you move to a company which do not pay people base on where they be from but rather for the quality of their work . or do as I do and move out of Dubai to a country where discrimination like this be not tolerate .

Going on a date I can barely eat anything because I m usually so excited 😅which kinda takes away my hunger . It’s mostly about spending time and getting to know each other . If you are meeting people through dating apps , then it’s best to filter them out. Yes the process maybe slow and can lead to you being impatient, but that’s the best way to avoid such gold diggers. Tbh I tried offering to split the bill but the guy always insists and says “ next time you can pay “ lol but yeah it’s best to go for coffee or tea , I guess Tim Hortons is quite reasonable

And the dating struggle is real for both the gender here in dubai . This is a transit location and no one is here for too long , if you are up for casuals then it’s easy but finding someone for the long run can be challenging.

I got the road test done on the first try (flawless, 0 minor mistakes even) but they failed me on the parking test once. The fail?

1193,comment,jotx7pj,2023-06-20 17:52:42,2023,"I mean in my opinion it is overhyped, but it still isn't a bad sunscreen?

Pros: lightweight, hydrating, nice for drier skin types and climates. When I feel oily, it weirdly has a temporarily mattifying effect but it doesn't last for hours on end..

Cons: has a small grey cast especially on darker/warmer complexions. It DID irritate my friend's very sensitive skin and seemed to cause a few closed comedones, was way too oily and greasy on her skin when layered up and I don't have oily skin. 😐

But you know what, you can find samples and use them, I once randomly found their samples at Carrefour","I mean in my opinion it be overhyped , but it still be not a bad sunscreen ?   pro : lightweight , hydrating , nice for dry skin type and climate . when I feel oily , it weirdly have a temporarily mattifye effect but it do not last for hour on end ..   con : have a small grey cast especially on dark / warm complexion . it do irritate my friend 's very sensitive skin and seem to cause a few closed comedo , be way too oily and greasy on her skin when layer up and I do not have oily skin . 😐   but you know what , you can find sample and use they , I once randomly find their sample at Carrefour"

1195,comment,joxm2ai,2023-06-21 11:09:18,2023,"Apologies, my question was on comparing the fairness aspect and not on a tangent as to who gets what compensation. I completely agree on the law for regulation of the rent. My comment was on how come the mortgage rates not being regulated as well.

However, to continue on with your points, note that if you're paying rent in Dubai, please don't victimise yourself as a peasant scraping on savings, you're much better than the ones staying in labor accommodations sending money back home to their families. Also, compensations from your employers aren't to be confused with savings from your expenses.

I believe UAE is a place where you get to decide what luxuries are your priorities. A person earning 7k can decide for themselves whether they want to have a car, a good place, fancy food/clothing or be really stringent to save up for down-payment to own a property.

At the end of the day, there was a surge of residents moving from economical Emirate, like Sharjah and Ajman, to Dubai during covid due to drop in rents and now that the rents are getting back, just like inflation of prices in other amenities, we would like to find fairness.
