Of course not. Unless you actually have skills/qualifications/experience that make you *worth* employing, companies are not just going to give you a job. They aren't charities.

This myth is usually thrown around by people bitter that Europeans tend to hold the top jobs. However they don't take into account that unless you are fairly highly qualified and have a managerial or technical position, it is generally not worth it for a European to move here - a blue collar worker would make more at home. Therefore it is mostly only more highly qualified Europeans who move here in the first place.

So if you just look at it superficially, you would get the impression that Europeans are ""handed"" better jobs when in practice it is simply self-selection - blue collar European workers have no reason to move here, unlike most blue collar workers from developing Asian/African countries who make several multiples what they would at home and therefore dominate these roles in Dubai.",employment,25

And it's second objective is also to wake up the muslim for the Fajr/Dawn prayer. It's literally saying ""Praying is more fruitful then Sleeping"" 
I guess it's one of the things you need to accept living in a Muslim country :)

This is because although most of the tenants of their compound were Muslim, they *all* had little children and toddlers who were sleeping very poorly to begin with when the mosque decided to double their speaker volume at adhan. They live in a sparsely populated area of Barsha so if they didn't speak up, there would be no one else to complain.

Any idea why they are as loud as they generally are? In the early hours of the day, especially, there isn't a lot of noise to drown out the sound.

co90q7u,"it has largely to do with mosque distribution in the area. the call for prayer is supposed to reach as many people as it can. so the fewer they are the louder they get in a set area.

you also need to be careful when requesting volume reduction and probably try to use some other excuse other than ""i can't sleep"" as a simple reply would be they aren't there for your comfort.",islam_religion,21

Those who live right next to it must be getting completely deafened every time if it's enough to wake me up in the mornings.

Audio set up for mosques is a sound engineering art on its own. There has to be a correct setting preset effects on the Imams voice and another for the moadins voices to make it appealing to hear for the neighbors as well as sound good to the listeners during prayer.

I guess this can be overlooked depending on who does the audio set up.",islam_religion,21
co9xnvb,"There are options. I had an issue with a mosque that had the loudspeakers facing my bedroom. My husband spoke to the sheikh and they turned it down for the morning prayers. It helped that I had both a newborn baby & an invalid mother-in-law in the house.   By the way, if you're going to talk to the sheikh, get a male (muslim preferably) to do so. They're more likely to be approachable that way. 

^^sorry, ^^^but ^^^it's ^^^true.

My mom, a devout muslim living in Sharjah no less, complained to the local authorities about a particularly loud mosque where the muezzin had both a bad voice and poor pronunciation. The muezzin was changed shortly thereafter, and though the sound is still loud, she no longer minds. :-/

I don't care where someone is educated, I dropped out of university but still did pretty well in my career through hard work.
However I've interviewed some people with 2 degrees who could hardly answer a few basic questions when asked.

To me job based knowledge, work ethic, communication skills, general writing skills, critical thinking, initiative, ability to take constructive critiscm, ownership, English language skills are all really important for me and the companies I've worked for.

It's difficult to explain without sounding prejudiced but certain ways of working I've seen from individuals from certain countries are not really compatible with the corporate culture of some businesses. 

As an example, where I'm from it is considered acceptable to challenge your boss on why decisions are made,  to acknowledge mistakes and accept responsibility, to say no to work when you think it can't be done or don't have time.  With a lot of Indian colleagues I've worked with, they would say that those sorts of things would be unacceptable in their work culture.  

I hope you take that in the way it was meant.  Just that in my experience as a Westerner, it can be difficult trying to adapt to Indian workplace culture and I'm sure the same true in reverse.

I've never had to do this before in the years that I've been flying Emirates, and it's really disappointing. I absolutely hate waiting at baggage carousels for my bag, hence I always pack light for my trips, but now enforcing a total carry-on weight of 7kg just adds even more delays when you're at the airport. Flew with Qatar airways a few weeks back and they just glanced at my carry-on and said it was fine and didn't need to be weighed. ",travelling,77

Etisalat is a semi government company, as is Du. So they control the content. Hense Du also blocking Skype, which was the topic at hand. 

Yes, they are publicly traded, so are Emirates and Etihad airways. Why would they not be? The government still has a say in how these business are operated, and that is to the benefit of the country, its culture and the business itself.

Then you bring up the fact that Etisalat operated in 16 countries, which only makes the topic more obvious. You think Etisalat is filtering the content in countries other than here? No, and then ask yourself why.

The fact that you even mention the BBC (A government funded company) and trying to say anyone is comparing them to a private company like Chanel 4 just shows how badly you are grasping any understanding of a basic comment like ""Du is just Etisalat wearing a different hat""

I'm Pakistani - I mean literally bleed green but my roots are in India so basically look south Indian. I mean I've often been mistaken for a mallu to the extent that people on the road have approached me and said malayalee Ile or somehting to that effect.

Was sitting in a meeting at a clients with mostly Indians and when we were done the topic somehow turned around to international politics where one of the Indians was questioned by an Arab on what the real problem is. The amount of hate spewing in that conversation shocked my eyes. Things about enough is enough. This time we won't let go and we need to teach Pakistan a lesson for eternity - I felt I was sitting with a bjp spokesperson. And then he turns around to me addresses me by name and says I mean you with your knowledge of current affairs would know more right? The look on his face when I said I'm Pakistani and while I understand his anger at what happened, what's happening right now is nothing but jingoism in an election year, and I would refrain from commenting further was PRICELESS. The Arab laughed out loud like there's no tomorrow. The Indian tried to back up but knew he'd fucked up.

He did call me back a bit later in the day and apologized quite a bit with the excuse he didn‚Äôt know I was Pakistani. I mean right that‚Äôs nice. If I wasn‚Äôt Pakistani you‚Äôd still hate us right?

And someone who has FOMO could very well get into the idea of not missing out, see the upward trend and try and get in to the real estate market now. Especially who are in here for expo, and could very much well be interested in living in Dubai/UAE because of the response to Covid here.

But on the other hand, what after expo? I don't think there will be any other reason or directive to keep increasing the rental prices or even the property prices. Once the extra people leave - all those who are employed at expo/just visiting expo and then when the tourist season is also over. What after that? Most likely we will see late 2020s prices again or even lower.

But the lady in the top floor right above me , would constantly throw her pet fur by dusting her pet bed and carpet on the balcony- -since I wasn‚Äôt using it other than drying clothes , I did not think much of it!!

One morning we decided to eat breakfast out- and we arrange and just sit and she can definitely see us from her angle  still decides to dust pet fur filled carpet right into us!- I called out to her and she just off handedly said ok and went off inside!!! No apologies!!!

And I think one day her very very expensive pet carpet fell into my balcony,, I just left it there hoping she would come get it! -she did not and it kept lying there for a couple of days- I just put it to the corner!!! More visible to her... after another few days another expensive carpet- I did not pick it -since I work almost 12 hrs a day plus travel- I am in the house for limited hour‚Äôs,,so I guess even if she did come to pick it - I did not knw , nor did she leave a note!

Then one afternoon  someone banged on my door - we just sat for lunch- we eat food on floor in a very traditional Asian way- so I told her to come back later and pick it !!! She made a big fuss and and screamed loudly( racial slur included-becse I‚Äôm brown and she is a privileged white) - I refused to let her in side the house and  she threatened to call the cops on me!!!! Saying I stole her expensive carpets !!!

I laughed at her breakdown and said sure - call the cops and closed the door!!  

She banged many times on my door ,, I have Chinese -Arabic neighbors who came out and everyone watching!!!

Afterwards one of  her friend comes and knocks my door and very politely apologize for her friend - I refused to accept her apology and said her friend need to apologize- but friend wouldn‚Äôt come to do that!!!  Her friend  started a story about how covid pressure and loss of job made her behave like that!!! 

I did not accept the apology and told her friend call the cops!!! 

I left for my duty and a couple of days later the neighbors told me she had to vacate cause of unable to meet rent!!!

But imagine threatening me with calling cops  for two carpets she dropped and refused to pick up and over time both completely covered by fur she kept throwing her pet fur down!!

Karma works in its own ways!

Not all neighbors I have had over the years behaved like this- most were generally nice and cordial!!

But some really make us think about how the Karen‚Äôs need to be given their own meds!!

After that I have never again stayed on mez floors as I don‚Äôt want such things to repeat and now love the higher floors!

Excluding or separating any part of the LGBTQ+ community goes against the idea of accepting and including everyone. We should stand together and support each other to make progress in fighting for equal rights and against discrimination.

Throughout history, the LGBTQ+ movement has been united, recognizing that transgender individuals, as well as lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals, have all contributed to the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. We should embrace understanding, empathy, and unity among all members of the LGBTQ+ community. Together, we can create a more inclusive society that values and celebrates the different identities and experiences within our community.",diversity_inclusion.sexuality,35

Pros: lightweight, hydrating, nice for drier skin types and climates. When I feel oily, it weirdly has a temporarily mattifying effect but it doesn't last for hours on end..

Cons: has a small grey cast especially on darker/warmer complexions. It DID irritate my friend's very sensitive skin and seemed to cause a few closed comedones, was way too oily and greasy on her skin when layered up and I don't have oily skin. üòê

joxm2ai,"Apologies, my question was on comparing the fairness aspect and not on a tangent as to who gets what compensation. I completely agree on the law for regulation of the rent. My comment was on how come the mortgage rates not being regulated as well.

However, to continue on with your points, note that if you're paying rent in Dubai, please don't victimise yourself as a peasant scraping on savings, you're much better than the ones staying in labor accommodations sending money back home to their families. Also, compensations from your employers aren't to be confused with savings from your expenses.

I believe UAE is a place where you get to decide what luxuries are your priorities. A person earning 7k can decide for themselves whether they want to have a car, a good place, fancy food/clothing or be really stringent to save up for down-payment to own a property.

At the end of the day, there was a surge of residents moving from economical Emirate, like Sharjah and Ajman, to Dubai during covid due to drop in rents and now that the rents are getting back, just like inflation of prices in other amenities, we would like to find fairness.

It's all over-the-counter pills; nothing that requires prescriptions (such as strong painkillers, antibiotics, or stuff related to psychiatry).

His birthday is coming up early June, and thankfully this year i managed to collect some savings that i‚Äôm planning to spend on his bday gift. i have around 500DHS rn.

however, when i went online to try and find a cat, they all were way more expensive than i anticipated. Cheapest was 1000DHS which is double what i have.

uulb2y,"looking for a roommate to live with in International City Phase 1 Hi, guys. I'm 28M from Pakistan. Very easy going and friendly and likes to keep things neat and clean. 
Looking for one or two roommate(s) to live with in International City Phase 1 in Studio/Masterbed. 

Monthly rent here is much cheaper max 2500/month. And studio and master apartments are way better and spacious than those claustrophobic bed spaces ü§Æ

Cost will be 1000-1200 per month in a spacious room, which is very good imo. We will try to look for one which includes all bills. We have to search there for studios/master beds. 

I don't mind a person of any ethnicity/religion. But the roommate should be trustable. This is the most important thing for me.

Please let me know. I have to shift before 1st of June",real_estate_housing,24
