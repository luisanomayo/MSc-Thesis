Not sure what you mean with groceries or food to be honest. We are lucky enough to live in a nice neighborhood but I do understand if you live in a dangerous and bad neighborhood it could be tough. I have felt very safe here so far.\n\nI didn't say it was the solution but just like you have been born and bred in Canada, I have grown up in Dubai and I know what it used to be and what it is now. The blind eye to slave labor hasn't changed and never will. Lack of freedom and increasing cost of living was also an issue for us. \n\nTo each his own but knowing both worlds, I could never set anchor in Dubai where I will never be treated as a permanent citizen and my wife will be treated like a second class person. It gave us a lot and I'm very thankful for it but we were ready to settle down and Dubai isn't the city for that."", 'Dude whoever is shit talking can fuck off, I\'m genuinely sorry that happened to you specially with family that is beyond disrespectful, something similar happened to me once I was in the car with family and some dude was doing the same thing flashing and tailgating and then he recklessly overtook us and opened his window and started flipping us off and shouting.  we actually got a fine for this because while he was so close to the car we ended up crossing the speed limit , anyways safety is more important than any of that so we pulled over whenever we reached a safe distance. The people talking about ""superior race "" can barely speak English and are barely even educated lol they\'re just trolling, they don\'t know any sense or weight of responsibility or accountability so let them be in their ignorance. I lived my life among these people, speak their language and I know there are good people and then there are people like you\'ve encountered who thinks everyone is so dumb and uneducated that they\'ll give in to the fact someone is claiming to be ""CID"" or ""police"" lol.To finish off, I just want to say may Allah give those people hidaya and may Allah reward your patience and I want you to know you did absolutely right by standing up to them and insha\'Allah I pray that you never encounter this again, and that also your health issues get better insha\'Allah. That\'s all I have to say thank you for reading, salam alaikum', '\tSoccer stars, actors and television personalities from Cristiano Ronaldo to Maya Jama were among those who enjoyed the holiday period in Dubai, working and playing in the Gulf tourist hotspot as Europe suffers under a strict coronavirus lockdown.\n\nAs 2021 began with barely a pop elsewhere, the airport in the United Arab Emiratesâ€™ trade hub has been rammed as British, French and Russian tourists flooded into what has recently become the worldâ€™s most open city, where visitors can enjoy restaurants, bars and even socially distanced raves.\n\nAfter a tough lockdown, the city started opening up its economy gradually in May. With the UAE rolling out a fast vaccination programme, bookings for the cityâ€™s hotels are buoyant and a moribund property market is resurgent.\n\nâ€œDubai has taken away impediments â€” people see somewhere relatively safe and so they are prepared to travel,â€ said Simon Casson, president of hotel operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at the Four Seasons group. â€œThere are few hotels in the world today that are enjoying the levels of demand that Four Seasons Dubai is.â€\n\nSince November, occupancy and rates at its two Dubai hotels had been increasing, reaching more than 90 per cent at the beach location in December, from lows in single digits during the summer, he said. In the first week of December, occupancy across Dubai reached 66 per cent, according to data provider STR.\n\n\tDubai, harder hit than the UAEâ€™s richer capital Abu Dhabi, has adopted easier entry requirements to boost tourism. Dubai requires some visitors to present negative Covid-19 tests at check-in and to take another on arrival, though Britons and Germans, like other Gulf nationals, only need to take a PCR test at Dubai airport.\n\nA more infectious new virus variant is present in the UAE and cases have surged since the new year. The authorities have so far only reminded people to adhere to social-distancing protocols.\n\n\tThe two-month revival in tourism, which together with the real estate sector accounts for about a third of the economy, is one part of a story about the emirateâ€™s resurgence since many of the foreigners it relies on left due to the pandemic. As much as 10 per cent of the 10m population, the vast majority of whom are expatriates, fled the country, western officials estimate.\n\nSince then the UAE, which has had about 700 reported deaths from coronavirus, has led the way with its vaccination drive. Dubai this month rolled out its BioNTech/Pfizer vaccination programme, which aims to inoculate 70 per cent of the population in 2021, building on the UAE campaign using Chinaâ€™s Sinopharm jab. The UAE is now second only to Israel in the global vaccination race, at 9 doses per 100 people, and plans to surpass its newfound ally. \n\n\tâ€œItâ€™s the only place I know where you can really live your normal life â€” theyâ€™ve got it all figured out â€” there are masks everywhere,â€ said John, a banker from New York, who has just moved his family to Dubai. \n\n\n\tPlease use the sharing tools found via the share button at the top or side of articles.\n\n\tWhile years of property oversupply continue to weigh on a market down 40 per cent from its 2014 peak, some districts are now starting to rebound.\n\nBen Kirkland, a commodities trader who agreed to buy a four-bedroom townhouse on the man-made Palm Jumeirah before the virus struck, thought he had made a terrible mistake when he got stranded abroad during the pandemic.\n\nBut he and his wife went ahead with the purchase and the value has since risen as much as 20 per cent. â€œIt ended up being a good decision, buying as close as possible to the bottom of the market.â€\n\n\tOutside tourism and property, many sectors are still suffering. In November, managers reported a fall in activity and the weakest growth in new business for five months, with a â€œsolid reductionâ€ in output, according to the IHS Markit Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index, which surveys business sentiment. While jobs continue to be lost, the rate of shedding has eased to its lowest level since the pandemic struck.\n\nTo spur the recovery, the government has introduced a raft of reforms to improve quality of life and attract foreign direct investment, including removing the requirement for an Emirati to hold 51 per cent of a business.\n\nWhile concerns remain about the emirateâ€™s overall debt burden, Hasnain Malik, a Dubai-based analyst with emerging market research house Tellimer, said these would be eased by low global interest rates, renewed tourism activity and implicit support from Abu Dhabi, which bailed it out previously.\n\nâ€œDebt is an Achilles heel, not a deal-breaker,â€ he said. â€œIf this holds up, exposure could turn into a driver as investors seek exposure to highly geared tourism economies.â€\n\nFor now, the party continues. The cityâ€™s new year celebrations were capped by the traditional sound, light and fireworks show around Burj Khalifa, the worldâ€™s tallest building, albeit with yellow â€œ#staysafeâ€ stickers marking out physical distancing.\n\nThe showâ€™s climax featured a slogan coined by Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Abu Dhabiâ€™s crown prince and the UAEâ€™s de facto leader, assuring the public about the countryâ€™s ability to deal with coronavirus: â€œDo not be concerned.â€']"

So rather than that a restaurant only being able to send two meals out an hour with their drivers - with zomato, talabat and deliveroo they can send out twenty.\n\nYes the unit economics are a bit different, but without these third party apps - restaurants would be much worse off. infact that list of restaurants that u/leqadayi posted would have been 10x longer.\n\nGoFood as an app is not good at all. the app doesn't even open for me anymore, and the usability is so poor. they made a big song and dance about 200 free dirham of credit, and then it had huge limitations on it.

The third time he cried for 2 seconds and then went quiet and started talking about something else. Distraction helps. Communication helps. And letting them\nKnow their drama is just not an okay way to communicate not only\nTells them how To Communicate but also who is the adult. Children who just learn to throw tantrums, or learn that parents will\nGive in or will\nJust let them cry forever, then loose the trust of an adult when they are actually hurt and needing attention. This is my\nSecond child, the first one was even more difficult, her training started a little later because I was waiting for let her cry it out. Doesnâ€™t help. They cry about everything and anything and louder every time. Did I let it wait till She was 4? No way. \n\nSaying this as a mother, yes parents with kids\nDo cut slack, parents with kids are also very well aware when a kid is crying or throwing tantrums versus just someone who is misbehaved throwing long tantrums because they wonâ€™t be stopped and are allowed to\nDo this. Please note that the other parents who might be around you or disapproving or unhappy, might have had a horrible\nDay at work, home or with own family and came\nOut to catch a break. Doesnâ€™t mean they need to be subjected to\nAnother ongoing torture session. Itâ€™s a trigger for this exact reason.', 'Everything you say is what I agree with except the part where you chose to say this to me on a thread where a jerk throws sexist comments and talks about hitting a child. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m gonna take that stand ! Yea crappy behaviour in children comes from parents being crap, as I stated earlier, children learn more by watching than being told. Discipline is learnt .. not taught by force. If you are considerate, your child will be too. You canâ€™t display inconsideration towards other but slap your kid into showing consideration. \n\nThis is why I got a sense that you ainâ€™t a parent. A child literally is a copy of the behaviours your display. So if a kid is being impossible itâ€™s cause of parents being disrespectful and probably have been lying to kid. Children show aggression out of unresolved feelings ! If they know they will be addressed, youâ€™ll see calm children !!! A calm family rarely has a hyper aggressive kid. A lying family who is violent .. always gets brats back.', ""I agree that trash parents could be the reason. But at that age, kids pick a lot of stuff from their friends at school (with trash parents, obviously). And they are also old enough to understand what can be said in front of parents, and what can be said in their absence. \n\nI am unsure how I would deal as a parent in this situation too. My kids are toddlers at the moment, and we, as a principle, do not refer to other kids by their color. So when we look at the school photos, we don't do things like 'what is this black girl's name'? \n\nBut it won't be long before they know they are people of different races. And they are going to see other kids bully other kids for their face, or color. And regardless of how well we bring them up, when a kid goes 'ching chong' and everyone laughs, my kid may find that funny too. And teaching them about how racism is bad is only going to make them not make those comments in my presence. \n\nSorry I am rambling, but I am unsure how to teach them those values when they are older.""]"

What a roller coaster of a ride in Dubai. Came here just before the pandemic. No job for 7 months to having a license today and hopefully a car soon! \n\nHere is my experience with the RTA:\n\n\n1. Joined the classes almost 2 months back. The first theory test is quite simple and youâ€™ll pass if you know the basics. Since I already had an Indian license, I didnâ€™t have the 40 classes. It was just 10. \n\n2. I went to a school called Drive Dubai in DIP2. My instructor was a gem of a person. Took his time, told me what exactly I needed to do to pass the tests. \n\n3. Parking is completely sensor based now. You have to do the whole process alone in a car. \n\nâ€” up hill \nâ€” emergency breaking \nâ€” Angle parking \nâ€” Garage parking \nâ€” parallel parking \n\nAll in one shot. There is always a simple trick to do all this (mirror points and practice). Ask your instructor for this. Once you do that, the chances of you failing is lesser. Please donâ€™t ever think that you already know parking. I have seen a lot of people who were doing their 7th parking attempt (each one is 280+ Tax). \n\nI took the single attempt package 3750 AED. \n\nOnce I was done with parking, I had to wait 4 weeks for my final RTA test. This is because of the current COVID situation. Only one person is allowed in the car other than the instructor. \n\nThe final test:\n\nI reached there at 7am (the test was at 7:30). Always reach early as youâ€™ll have time to relax and be alert. \n\nThe instructors came one by one and started calling names. My instructor was super professional, asked my name and my EID, told me to not panic and that if I know driving, itâ€™s a matter of 5 mins. He told me I can start the car whenever I feel comfortable and no need to hurry. We started and he gave basic instructions like take right, take left etc. \n\nBe confident, donâ€™t go slow. RTA hates it when you go slow. Keep the speed limit. While I was driving the final test, there were 2 trucks on the right lane going really slow. I asked my instructor if I can go around them as itâ€™ll take time. Be confident, donâ€™t drive to pass, drive like you do. Safely and confidently. He said yes and then he told me â€œyou drive well, donâ€™t worryâ€. That moment was amazing. Total omg moment. We took 2 roundabouts and was back to the school. He said you passed, congratulations. That moment was bigger than my graduation. Went back to the institute and got my printed license in like 20 mins. \n\nThatâ€™s it. \n\nSome points to note:\n\n1. The examiner is Extremely professional and friendly. They will never fail you if you drive confidently. Itâ€™s a myth that they will fail people deliberately. \n2. Dress well. Not like to a black tie event. Just look pleasant enough. \n3. Greet your instructor. \n4. Itâ€™s a no brainer that you need to use the indicator when you turn. Always signal before the 75m board before a roundabout. \n5. On the solid white line, count backwards from 1005 to 1000. Thatâ€™s about 5 secs exactly. You need to stop for 5 seconds regardless of vehicles approaching. \n6. If there is a road joining from left or right, always take a look whether a vehicle is approaching or not. Donâ€™t sit and look straight. \n7. Check your mirror every 40-50 seconds. \n\nThatâ€™s it guys. All the best to everyone taking the exam.', 'Hey, do you have to take extra classes if you fail your final test?
