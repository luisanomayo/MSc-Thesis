Agree that Schools maybe understaffed but the education system in Canada is significantly better than the ones found in the UAE. And this is comparing Canada\'s PUBLIC system to UAE\'s PRIVATE schools, let alone UAE\'s poor public system. And needless to say there is essentially no school fees in Canada. Now if we are talking about universities, Canada has some of the best in the world, and get this, for CHEAPER tuition than the UAE (specifically if you are a resident or citizen of Canada). Cold weather may not be appealing since we gave grown accustomed to the desert life, but we can\'t pretend that the summers here are pleasant. It\'s OK if you have a car for the most part but you can say the same in Canada. The major annoying part of Canada\'s weather is the snow and shoveling it. But besides that you can keep warm by dressing up. Regarding salaries, we all know that the UAE typically has such a big range of salaries for the same job. You maybe have someone getting paid 4k to another person\'s 25k. You mention it\'s higher here suggests that you might be on the higher end. However if you would compare the medians to each country, I believe Canada\'s would be higher. Not to mention things like minimum wage, better benefits etc. Yes there are high income tax but that provides some (not the best) things in return such as free Healthcare, cheap schools, unemployment insurance, cheap electricity and water, heating, etc. So it\'s not like your money is just gone after you get taxed. Keep in mind a lot of things in the UAE are subsidized or the government is paying for it but that\'s because it\'s a rich country blessed with natural resources. But I\'m sure everyone is noticing the taxes and fees that are being introduced recently (I predict an income tax coming in the next 3 years). And all the ""innovation and knowledge"" fees 😂.', 'FULL TEXT Give us your doctors, your inventors, your huddled scientists Dec 9th 2021 ONE DAY soon Kamal will have to leave. The Indian expat has done office jobs in Bahrain since the 1990s. They paid well enough to put his kids through school and provide a modest nest-egg. Retirement beckons. Yet he finds the prospect unsettling. It means a one-way ticket back to a place where he has not lived in decades. “I’ll leave a place with all my memories for a country I don’t recognise,” he says. Such stories are common in the Gulf. Of the 59m people who live in the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), about half are foreigners. Some stay for a few years; others spend entire careers. Almost all, however, arrive with the understanding that they must eventually depart. Gulf states have long bristled at the idea of offering citizenship to expats. Locals fear it would change their national identity. Governments are not keen to extend costly benefits to foreigners. For most foreigners, life in the Gulf involves a string of short-term work visas: cease to be productive, and you cease to be a resident. This is slowly changing. In January the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced that certain foreigners, such as doctors, inventors and scientists, could be nominated for citizenship. Saudi Arabia said in November that it had naturalised an undisclosed number of expats. Most Gulf states now offer long-term residence visas that do not require work. A new scheme in the UAE allows expats to retire in the country instead of returning home. None of this is a “path to citizenship” as many liberal democracies would define it. Only an elite group is eligible: a talented scientist could become an Emirati citizen, but not the janitor who cleans his lab. The numbers are tiny. The UAE will naturalise only around 1,000 people a year, or 0.01% of its population. Long-term visas are tied to wealth, with requirements for income or investment that exclude most workers. Still, even these small steps break a long-held taboo. In 2013 Sultan al-Qassemi, a member of the ruling family in Sharjah, part of the UAE, published an op-ed urging the state to naturalise talented foreigners. It caused an uproar. On social media many Emiratis replied with a hashtag that translates as “this writer does not represent me”. The steps raise complicated questions about citizenship and identity in the GCC. Even for native-born khaleejis (Gulf Arabs), citizenship is not a right enjoyed equally. If a Bahraini man marries a foreign woman, his wife may apply for his nationality and his kids automatically receive it. Reverse the sexes, though, and no such rights exist. When a Gulf woman marries a foreigner, their children are typically treated as foreigners. Mothers in Bahrain may sponsor them as dependants until they are 18, renewing their papers every two years; after that, children must secure their own residency or leave. “You can imagine, this issue leads to a lot of complaints,” says Ali al-Dirazi, the head of Bahrain’s state-run human-rights agency. The UAE’s new citizenship scheme has prompted a rare debate about such things. Jawaher al-Qassemi, the wife of Sharjah’s ruler, posted a short comment on Twitter: “Naturalisation for the children of female citizens. That’s a demand,” she wrote. Other Emiratis voiced similar feelings. Several Gulf states also have populations of so-called bidoon (people “without” papers), who did not register as citizens at independence. Kuwait has at least 100,000 of them. They are broadly excluded from good jobs and social services. Newly minted citizens will receive rights denied to natives for half a century. Foreigners naturalised in the UAE will be free to live and work in a rich country, and to travel on a passport that ranks as one of the world’s most useful. The government is vague as to whether they will enjoy other privileges. Native-born Emiratis receive everything from cheaper mobile-phone plans to interest-free housing loans. Some receive grants of up to 70,000 dirhams ($19,000) when they get married. If rights are unclear, so are responsibilities. Since 2014 Emirati men have been required to perform military service. The law does not say if naturalised citizens (or their descendants) face the same burden—though perhaps not, since there seems to be no requirement that they know Arabic. They will be allowed to keep their original nationality, whereas native-born Emiratis cannot hold a second passport. Some fret the government has created a two-tier model of citizenship. The citizenship law is part of a head-spinning package of reforms implemented by the UAE over the past year. Unmarried couples may now legally live together. Muslims may drink. In November Abu Dhabi, the capital, decided to allow civil marriages for non-Muslims. On December 7th the UAE announced that it would shift the public sector to a Monday-to-Friday work week, from Sunday-to-Thursday, bringing it in sync with most of the world (but out of step with many Arab countries). Much of this simply legalises reality: there are lots of cohabiting singletons and carousing Muslims in Dubai. Yet the changes have come with little public debate in a country where space for criticism is almost non-existent. The same goes for naturalisation schemes. Even before the oil boom, the Gulf’s coastal towns and pilgrimage routes were melting pots. Today their citizenry includes sizeable populations of ajam, whose ancestors hail from Persia, and Afro-Arabs, descendants of East Africans brought to the region as slaves. Diversity was, and is, one of the region’s strengths. To varying degrees, though, locals live apart from foreigners in their midst. Their dress is distinct and they work mostly in the public sector. No one is sure how new citizens will fit into this milieu. Though they have broken a taboo, Gulf rulers have not changed a social compact that treats citizenship as a gift bestowed on worthy subjects. They have just expanded the pool of worthy subjects in order to attract and retain talented foreigners—part of a broader scramble to diversify oily economies. For most foreigners, and for many locals, the path to citizenship will remain blocked.#', ""Habibi come to Dubai I'm sick of my life here.

Even if you insist on it, there are more chances of you being antagonized than understood. This isn't just the case with my field of work, I've seen it for others I know as well. This is the case in most Asian countries. Western Culture is different in that aspect. Yes there are a few tradeoffs but as I said before if your priority is work life balance then you'd understand my venting. If you don't understand then you could at least try rather than being rude. A little humanity goes a long way which is exactly what I was crying for in this post. Sorry to bother tho. You can carry on with your lifestyle hating on others. You do you. I was just venting.

And the worst part? **The restaurant foots the bill.** Meaning, the commission the restaurant is charged is calculated on the original item amount, **NOT** the discounted amount. * When the restaurant can no longer afford giving out huge commissions, restaurants are forced to increase their prices so they make some money after paying commissions. **This translates to higher prices for you**, the customer. &#x200B; ***What can you do? SOS.*** ***S*****upport local,** ***O*****rder direct,** ***S*****ave more.** Yes, ordering directly means that restaurants don\'t pay that huge commission. It means that they can *continue to offer us all great food at great prices*. At ChatFood, we charge restaurants a flat, affordable subscription of 300-800dhs/mo, depending on their size and order volume. *Nothing more.* &#x200B; ***How do you order directly?*** For restaurants that are part of the ChatFood community, you can visit their online profiles, and place your order through a menu that is easy to use, offers live tracking, remembers your user information like locations and card details **-- without downloading another app!** Simply visit the restaurant\'s Instagram/Facebook/Website, or reach out to them via WhatsApp/FB messenger, and place your order through their ChatFood link. [Here\'s how it looks.]( &#x200B; The best part is that since ChatFood restaurants aren\'t paying commission, **they can pass on the savings to you, the customer**. And not only that, many of the ChatFood restaurants have enabled their own loyalty programs, which means that **you can earn cashback** every single time you order - *this is a huge benefit for you,* as you know that you\'re saving money+supporting the restaurant, *and it\'s great for the restaurants as it\'s affordable*, and much easier for them to track. And again: it\'s on the restaurant\'s terms, *we don\'t expect or force them to do anything.* &#x200B; So, **dear hungry reader!** Please, support restaurants directly!

The SUV driver will be issued a fine for his mistake, whereas the person who got hit will be transferred to a hospital **where his/her insurance company will take care of all the bills**. The last part is very important here, because if the person involved does not have a valid health insurance, well then (s)he must have deep pockets. Once the person in hospital recovers, you can proceed to file a separate police complaint against the driver of the SUV, which will essentially be a damages claim. After preliminary investigation by the Police (for that particular case), it will be forwarded to Court where you basically have to follow it as a Civil Law Suit. This is where you lawyer up and wait for the final verdict. (The SUV driver may or may not be held in jail during the course of this trial). Once you receive the verdict, the court will announce the penalty amount to be paid by the SUV Driver, whereby the latter can also proceed to challenge the decision for a reduced penalty. I can understand your emotions, and do not want to comment on the actual causes which may have led to the incident. But you must understand that legal and emotional do not mix together. If the hit and run results in the death of one of more persons, well ... then the sh\\*t just gets real for the offender, where he will have to bear a jail term as well as pay the blood money as ordered by courts. P.S. A note to all pedestrians. You must always make sure the way is clear before you move forward EVEN IF you have a right of way. Something which very few pedestrians actually do, and then say stupid sh\\*t like ""the other party should stop because my way is green"".

But now as I learn an European language having left the UAE, I am trying to figure out what went wrong. Two decades in UAE and barely any language fluency for me. People say the arabic education system for expats suck but I've seen first hand how it's the society which treats it as a burden. They treat it as if it cannot go together with their STEM subjects (especially Indians due to horrid rote system). Arabic is first to be neglected. My school teachers would actually bargain with my Arabic teacher for extra slots. The kids wouldn't listen to the teacher. The teacher I had was amazing but not only deprived of any ability to properly teach but severely undercut, you see the example I provided above. This is never the case with other countries. I see plenty of same kind of people go to Germany after studying German for 1 year. I am more or less in the same category. Ofcourse, Will Power is #1 and I have failed when it comes to Arabic. However, there needs to be something done more. English alternatives are overwhelming. It is extremely hard to get by in many European countries as a resident without knowing the language. I really loved the move in Dubai where some English Translations were replaced by Transliterations on road signs not so long ago. This was crazy enough for Jumeirah Janes to start going crazy on social media. This motivates people to learn. In Europe, They offer long term residencies which is a big motivator for the people. In the GCC, People don't get that long term incentive oe anything else. I've seen hundreds of people tell me they are gonna leave UAE in 2 years. 20...30 years later, they are still here. Other's who planned to live long, ended up losing jobs and packing up in 5. Amidst all this, I will always have a deep regret for missing out on Arabic. I hope I can learn it. Infact I think I know less Arabic now than I used to know as a kid when hanging out with arab kids, fighting with them and playing football in the streets 😂 Ironically, I have been using more Arabic in Europe than UAE when I talk in broken Arabic to a Syrian kid (refugee) who doesn't speak English. *TL: DR* Expats live for decades here, don't know arabic. This is a multi faceted complex problem which must be tackled. I believe every language is special. There is never a disadvantage when you learn a language. Arabic is too neglected for expats. Needs reform and incentives.""]"

Plus on the rare occasion we do get rain, it leaves things coated in dust with heavy water marks. Its no different than trying to keep your car clean, and most importantly without damaging the surface. The best way to protect the panel is to cover panels with glass, which is a whole other subject as you have to use a very hard heat resistant type and do it in a way that causes the least amount of solar panel efficiency and not create a space for humidity to form. Many people have tried other materials but it never ends well.
