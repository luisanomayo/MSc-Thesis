Networking was most important for me; showing my face, getting lunch or snacks, inviting to fishing trips in Marina, attending conferences/expos in hotels, anywhere to isolate the person, strike up a conversation and proceed to show off my half baked projects that I do for ""fun"". Linkedin was only useful for one thing for me. It helped me learn about the person I am dealing with because everyone on that platform **LOVES** to volunteer information for free. Does the VP love motorsport? invite him to go karting, does a retail manager loves art? bring an arts & craft workshop to their attention. Does the head of department enjoys rugby? start shitposting about his favorite team and let him invite you to a weekend match in some sport center even if you\'re shit at the game. Is the person involved in genuine or shading business? Skim their profile to find out. LinkedIn is a tool for me, to look into the lives of ""*important*"" people who are trying to impress others. It help me get great jobs over the years. The interview they set up for me was for formality and paperwork records. HR culture in this part of the world needs to innovate themselves if they want to be able to handle the volume of applications they get.', ""Since I wrote that comment, I can explain in a bit more detail. I was too harsh to paint the whole of Dubai with the same brush based on such a short visit. I visited for 3 weeks while working as a contractor on an event in the Mall of the Emirates. Most of my time was spent working on the show, making sure things ran smoothly, doing a lot of lifting, working with local companies to source some tools & last-minute things, etc. Long days and very tiring. I got maybe 2-3 hours to hang by the hotel pool, get some food in the evening, etc. before I had to go to bed after work to do it again the next day. Our hosts were very keen to show us 'the best' of Dubai, and for them that meant hyping up all the blingy restaurants, expensive shops, etc. It wasn't a holiday for me, and that certainly wouldn't be what I would want to see if I did visit as a tourist. It's not a reflection on the people of Dubai, but there is an image that seems to be portrayed to 'tourists', 'westerners', or whatever you want to call it that seems to push this image of Dubai as a modern metropolis. To me that outlook feels very shallow, and it comes at a huge human and financial cost. I would have liked to see old Dubai and understand more of the history of the nation & region. I have visited some other Muslim nations such as Morocco, Turkey & Jordan, and in all of those places I explored similar things and found them very interesting. Some cultural aspects such as lack of some freedoms for women are also troubling for me, but I understand that these are engrained in the local customs and religion, and it's not really my place to say what is best for the people of the UAE in that regard. It made my female colleagues uneasy, which also made me uncomfortable at times. As westerners, perhaps they were not treated 'the same' as locals, but nevertheless this sense existed, whether it was real or not."", 'I feel like Thanos with all the infinity stones *snap* Edit: I can\'t believe the support on this post.

Some fundamental issues that IMO need resolving to reduce the tailgating phenomenon are: - As pointed out by several other comments, traffic enforcement is light and people only drive the speed limit due to the cameras. The problem is in-between the cameras you will find a lot of motorists decide to “camera chase” or drive above the speed limit until the next camera. This naturally creates tailgating situations as motorists going the maximum speed limit in the left lane will automatically get tailgated by the “camera chaser”(s). To stop this the authorities should implement speed time traps instead of radars on major highways. They are already common in Europe but basically you measure the time at which a vehicle passes a certain point, then measure again once the same vehicle passes another point. The distance between the two is known and therefore the time it takes to traverse between the two points at the maximum speed limit is also known. You go faster then that minimum time and jig is up for any camera chaser. - The difference in average speeds between the left lane and the adjacent lane is generally ridiculous. If the left most lane is doing 120, generally the adjacent lane is anywhere between 100-80. This should not be the case especially considering the amount of lanes, and some roads (like Sheikh Zayed) don’t even have the usually very slow moving commercial/industrial traffic of trucks in the right most lanes. This phenomenon can be attributed (at least in some part) to the difference between the posted speed limit and the speed limit that the radars are set to. Many tourist/new residents are either not aware or just don’t want to take the risk and this results in a large percentage of people driving 20 under the limit. I applaud Abu Dhabi’s initiative in getting rid of this downright confusing system (but hey you can’t get the lowest categories of speeding tickets if the radars don’t flash until your “at-least 30 over the speed limit” \U0001fae0) And I have seen others saying “right lane is driving lane and the rest are overtaking lanes”, even in Germany that is not always the case and there the average motorist is 10x more capable then most here. So saying that adds absolutely NOTHING as it’s so far detached from the actual reality here.', '>I am so glad that we are on the same page. ""I can assure you UAE has more precautions than better most countries,"" Lies!!!! this is what I dislike, do you think in the US/Canada someone can put 10 - 12 laborers in a single dorm with bunk beds and feed them rice and lentils? all day every day!! I have seen worse than that , do you remember when Canada opened her doors for refugees in 2015, I am a Canadian since my very first day on this earth, So I was given the option to help the refugees and get them what they need. I didn\'t take that offer becasue I didn\'t want to be out of my house for long period of times, but my friends did! They came back SHOCKED ON THE SITUATION THAT MOST REFUGEES LIVE IN , a family of 6 were literally housed in an 2 Bedroom apartment! Yes I am not going to lie that a good amount of refugees were given salaries not even a citizen took, I have heard people talking over 10K salaries a month; but thats not everyone! I have seen it ! &#x200B; >Engineers hail from India, Lebanon, and Jordan was paid peanuts (5,500 AED a month) and had unpaid salaries and benefits of around 40k AED. 800 of them. Thats entry level salary in the gulf , thats not something shocking, my father is an Engineer (SO I KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT) ! ; do you really expect someone who just graduated to have a salary over 70K د.إ , thats the salaries of Senior Engineers, and Senior Project Managers; and GM minimum salary is around 140,000 د.إ there is no way that can happen , unless everyone works his butt off to reach these salaries! I agree with you that they need their salaries negotiated to be risen but not to the same level of a senior project manager or GM, because as simple as it could be , thats disrespectful for the senior engineers and their expertise! I am not an engineer but anyone with experience of Senior Engineers have the right to get these salaries! Hopefully you understood me! People like you expect the entry level salaries to be over the top, it will never happen, and you need to accept the fact, if your early on in your career and you ended up working blue-collar jobs, then my advice is save up and go back continue your education because if you think that the blue-collar jobs salaries will end up being higher than GM , Senior Managers you are really hallucinating and deluded , its that simple! Everything comes with it experience! &#x200B; >hese employers get an abysmal fine for delaying(read not paying) the fucking wage!!! They literally just fixed this issue the start of July , and I love how you mention that you don\'t want to ever life in UAE but your literally invested your time to get every single OUTDATED INFO ABOUT UAE , its quite OBVIOUS YOU HATE THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE GULF TO BE SPECIFIC! &#x200B; >and if someone is unwilling to work and would like to cancel the visa he needs to incur the visa expenses the company already paid for!!! what a predatory system shrouded under the glitz and glamour!! Of-course because early on when visas got issued and it happens till today that people lie about their will to come to work in that specific company , so by the time they finish training in that specific company they run! I live in another GCC country and I can assure it happens in every single GCC country! People come on a different company that issues visa and they already have a job-lined up; they just worked on Company A because Company B doesn\'t issues Visa! After they finish training in Company A they literally dip ! If you opened a damn company and people used you as an easy entry to the country your based in; wouldn\'t you get pissed, because the visa process and the fees are not PEANUTS , they are in the thousands per PERSON! OF-course they would want re-payments ! Companies doesn\'t grow their money from trees! Its that simple! &#x200B; &#x200B; >I can go on and on and on. Until every one of you develops empathy for those downtrodden like the activist Ahmed Mansoor, people will point fingers to the Arab state.\'The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members\' &#x200B; Same things goes to you guys , on how you guys ruined millions of millions of Iraqis and killed millions of Iraqis , we will point our fingers toward you guys until the soliders ; politicians , families of politicians; families of soilders get prosecuted for the damages that happened in Iraq. We will point our fingers until people like George Bush Jr gets prosecuted, we are going to point our fingers until your country pays back Iraqis and Afghanstani people and anyone who got affected by the Arab Spring that your f\\* country orchestrated in the shadows, and we will take it from your Tax-paying money ! Your last sentence just proved how you hate the Arab-states ! It has nothing to do with Blue-collar people, your people doesn\'t live a decent life in America, I don\'t even want to start talking about America, for the simple reason we don\'t care, America to us is like a Trash-Can , literally! If you think your country is as strong as before, it was never was; and by the way , America is literally surviving by Middle-Eastern Oil, so WAKE THE DAMN UP , AMERICA NEEDS US , WE DON\'T NEED THEM! TALK ABOUT AMERICAS PROBLEM AND DOESN\'T TALK , MAKE A DIFFERENCE THEN COME AND ACT LIKE D\\*H AND TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE WAY HIGHER STANDARDS THAN YOUR A\\* , IN ETHICS , IN LIFE-STANDARDS, IN PERSONALITY , IN EVERYTHING! WATCH-OUT! &#x200B; WHEN YOUR COUNTRY FIXES THEIR PROBLEM THEN COME TALK ABOUT OURS! GOOD LUCK IN FIXING IT , WHILE HAVING A WALKING DEAD PRESIDENT!', 'You have a lot of good points but I disagree on “the mentalities must change on both sides”. I’m an Arab guy, I can assure you what needs to change the most is Emiratis mentality, not generalizing, but I mean the ones who are expecting high salaries. Hear me out. Here in UAE, we are in the middle between East and West. You are right, a company can easily get a software developer for 3k from India, or get a software developer from Poland for 30k, both options are available and they have been since the country started. This won’t go away anytime soon. It’s part of the social fabric here that some people are ok with 3k and some people won\'t come for less than 30, and you will find companies for both. Now, why am I saying some Emiratis need to change a bit. NOT because you will compete with the 3k guy (some Arabs/Emiratis might and that\'s fine) but most Arabs and Emiratis want to be in the 15k+ category. For this one, we have to show that we have similar or better qualities than people who usually get hired here. Someone might think I\'m being racist or stereotyping. Look around you, are there Indians in high paying jobs? Yes 100%. Are there Arabs or Emiratis leading huge corporations? Yes 100%. The answer is, this Indian guy didn\'t start with 3k and stayed there or didn\'t even want to start at 3k because they worked hard on their skills to prove they aren\'t in the 3k category. I will end this with a small example. I met a local guy, 100% local, in a company a few months back. I was introduced to him by his manager (an Jordanian guy), I asked what do you do here? He said I\'m an SAP specialist (an Enterprise system for managing companies), I was curious, I asked him if he was a local he said yes. I asked if ""x person (his manager)"" is paying him well. He said I get 32k. I got curious and asked what led to you becoming a SAP expert in a private company. He told me he studied IT, started as an intern there, learned many areas of the company and got interested in ERP systems. He worked hard on understanding it well and asked the company to help him get training. A few years pass and our guy became one of the top experts in SAP in this firm. This is the kind of mentality that applies to both Arabs and Emiratis.']"

You can’t step outside for 5 mins without getting drenched. (I walked for like maybe 2 mins to a near photostudio and whatcha know, sweat sweat sweat.) The window part happens in the morning (sometimes carries on till afternoon) also because that’s how high humidity is. Like the metro station entrance and mall as well. And ofc, if the AC is at full blast at night, then with 60-65% humidity, it’ll happen too. And who can forget, the loo. The hot air just blasting on your face.

But then again, for the people rain in uae is a rare thing. So flash flood must come across more amusing than alarming? No warnings or alert were also given by the authorities. I think only today morning, they have properly processed how damaging and dangerous the situation is. I kept looking to understand what happened because it doesn't make sense. Your insight makes a lot of sense. The area around fujairah is surrounded by mountains, and usually in winter(November to January) when it rains a lot, the water flows from these mountains and causes minor inconvenience. Usuallly the roads will be under water even after 3-5 days of heavy rain. Thats the worst that has happened. Since there are many wadis, and valley like place between these moutains, they hold of most of water. So i was wondering what happened this time? Its in the middle of the summer, and it only rained in fujairah city for a day and a half. The dams are usually made before i was even born, and it's usually pretty empty especially in summer. Its so dry, you can see cracks. Im sure nobody was monitoring it either. We dont have enough amenities to deal with issues like this, and it has happened for the very first time that im sure even the authorities were completely overwhelmed. The funny thing is, my friends on the other side of town were telling that it's okay and its not too bad. Tell your parents to stay home etc. While this side was completely flooded. I am perplexed why information was not send out? Nobody was there at fujairah police to pick up, and i tried dubai police twice and they were so indifferent and asked me to call fujairah police like they didn't know the severity of the issue. I hope nobody got hurt even though that's wishful thinking. If this was a preventable, its too disappointing. Because a lot of families there dont have the financial support to reinstate their homes. The jobs there aren't high paying, and we have lost everything. The disaster management in this country needs to be improved. But then again, all of these are a first to the country.""]"

I am in the IT field with more than 6 years experience here in the UAE and the US bachelors degree from the US and cloud certifications (Huawei, studying for AWS) Ive applied for more than 80 jobs per week and i have not received a single call back. What am i doing wrong?', 'I see your comments my comrades. Interesting how many are stuck in a career rut. It has its pros and cons. My only advice is to never give up. How I\'m trying to tackle this problem: 1. Firstly try to maintain your relevance and importance at work...if you\'re not in a financial or work/life position to quit. If you\'re able to quit and survive for six months out here and focus full time on a job search, and able to secure visa for that long etc.... by all means do it. 2. Rack up on a certification or two. No need to shell out 100K dirhams for a Masters. I mean great if you can but it\'s not a must. Certifications, skills, etc for free + low budget (ie max 5000 dirhams for a 3 month Harvard program...). Lots of free stuff on Google, or you can pay the monthly LinkedIn fee and do LinkedIn learning. 3. Speaking of LinkedIn. Don\'t be cringe level, but post an article every week or so. Comment on relevant topics where you can add your valued expertise. 4. Reach out to recruiters and engage with them. Show them that you\'re serious about shifting / moving. LinkedIn, word of mouth, face to face, your friends. Maybe a trustworthy colleague or two at work...though that can be risky but I\'ve seen people from within help people get the f*ck out of their rut. 5. Apply to relevant jobs, customize your resume and cover letter accordingly. 6. If when you get an interview, try to get a reference from a friend inside. I\'ve done this and it speeds up the process. Though I ended up not winning the final interviews...lol obviously that\'s on me. 7. Yeah, so practice your interviewing. A lot of interviews are casual conversations, but don\'t take it too casually. This is where you casually show off your expertise and ability to express your ideas and added value. There is hope. I\'ve seen ""hopeless"" people get out of their job-rut and relaunch their careers. Good luck. And don\'t give up. Feel free to DM me. We\'re in this together.', 'Well, your concerns are - not relevant. This is a concern you will ALWAYS have, forever. In any job. Good work = get new work, train people = possibility you get fired. Has always be like this. Here is the trick, though - you have always the time advantage. There really is only so much someone can learn in 6 months, and you have another 6 months headstart. Just make sure you are current on productivity gains. Which right now compared to when you started are insane - you DO know how to talk to your copilot, right? if you do not - HE WILL. And this means he will beat you in productivity and understanding of the business side into pulp, without getting out of his chair. See it like this. You have a job. That job, this career likely, will not survive the next decade. Trust me, way before 2035, unless you are REALLY top 1%, your work will not be there at all. Gone. Like, btw., a LOT of other work. So, I suggest you just do what they ask, take the money, and study something interesting - english and psychology may be some good ideas, clear communication may be key, as well as possibly philosophy, or become a comedian (not my advice - I was literally told that job may likely survive) for a long term potential in a career. And when I mean study, I do not mean ""go to university""; I mean read some books or engage in some of those brutal esoteric discussions I have at the moment about the future of economy with essentially a glorified (and i mean brutally glorified) spell checker. Which supposedly is about 400 lines of code. And can - let\'s not go there. Jesh, and I thought I have a lot of knowledge. Because I currently project that in 10 years from now, I really do not know how Dubai will look then, but there will be very little work left for you or me or most other people to do. You will see that in likely 2024 when house staff is getting help and people i.e. cleaning cars are - well, they are really cheap, but man, everyone higher up.... I already have a robot washing my floor every day (and it is so absolutely STUPID that it has to accept specific voice commands) and I am waiting to give him a real robot as help, once they get on sale in 2024.

Give it 3 years and lower end IT people get the boot. it is all a matter, essentially, of context - hard to properly program if your context window is a joke. And yes, I work in this field.

4,3,2233,3_tip_talabat_deliveroo_zomato,"['tip', 'talabat', 'deliveroo', 'zomato', 'restaurants', 'order', 'discount', 'food delivery', 'customers', 'apps']",delivering_services_shopping,"[""Totally agree with the crazy tip asking. In general I prefer card transactions and depending on how I feel about the food or service or whatever I tip.. as for food delivery. just FYI talabat drivers make about 3968 AED average as per Google, and that's actually not that bad.. do I still tip, maybe sometimes. Have you guys noticed that even after paying for Zomato Pro you still sometimes pay delivery charges?? Most of this I believe goes to the rider"", ""Unpopular opinion here, the aggregators actually saved restaurants during COVID19 - and continue to do so. Aggregators spend a lot of money on really good customer experience in terms of the platform as well as marketing to get people onto the platforms and buying from restaurants they potentially never would have before. what's more, last mile delivery costs a huge amount of money, and how the apps work is by providing volume to a restaurant. So rather than that a restaurant only being able to send two meals out an hour with their drivers - with zomato, talabat and deliveroo they can send out twenty. Yes the unit economics are a bit different, but without these third party apps - restaurants would be much worse off. infact that list of restaurants that u/leqadayi posted would have been 10x longer. GoFood as an app is not good at all. the app doesn't even open for me anymore, and the usability is so poor. they made a big song and dance about 200 free dirham of credit, and then it had huge limitations on it. The customer service is really bad. If you think these apps can really survive on 5% commission, you are kidding yourself, and then if these apps are gone, there is most of your delivery revenue as well. 30% commission is also a number that has been bandied about - and for the high high majority of restaurants this is widely untrue. So before you think 3rd party operators are the bad guys - they actually helped out restaurants a lot during the pandemic, talabat offered free delivery for customers to local restaurants to encourage ordering locally, as well as deferring commission and zomato also made funds. the only ones who didn't do much were deliveroo. Instead of looking at aggregators who bring a lot of value to your business, why don't you look at the other parts of your supply chain which don't, i.e the landlords who wouldn't lower rent or give rent holidays, or the suppliers who wouldn't offer better trading terms, or financial incentives etc. It's easy to blame the last part of the supply chain - you know, the one that actually **earnt** you revenue and was the business that stopped the F&B industry from being totally wrecked, and while it is not replacing dine-in, at least they are part of a solution. I'm not discounting your plight, but you did not show a clear picture. EDIT: This is where some of my research above came from - couldn't find the piece, but finally found it - talabat's CEO talking about the economics of delivery. it's also interesting that they are home-grown, and support 2000 employees across the region - rather than deliveroo or zomato who are based out of the UK and India... &#x200B; ["", ""Why restaurants are closing down... [u/leqadayi]( posted a list of restaurants that have closed. As a restauranteur, I'd like to give you all a detailed insight into why this is happening and why the restaurant industry is on it's knees. &#x200B; Even before covid-19, the restaurant industry was struggling with costs and competition. Dubai has one of the highest density of restaurants in the world per sqkm. Did you know that 50% of the restaurants revenue is generated by delivery? With the introduction of 3rd party services like Zomato and deliveroo and talabat, the restaurants highly depend on them as they spend millions upon millions to acquire you as their customer. That was good as long as they used to charge 5% in commissions which restaurants would consider as their cost of marketing. &#x200B; Soon, that 5% became 10 and then 15. These companies then started offering last mile delivery services which took the load off the restaurant for keeping high paid staff for delivery not understanding that they were succumbing to giving up their most treasured possession. Their customer. &#x200B; Once the customer migrated their loyalty to these 3rd party services, these services started pushing restaurants to give discounts to the customers to ensure they remained with them and did not go other aggregators they were competing against. &#x200B; Now keep in mind none of these aggregators like zomato or talabat or any other are making money. Their value only depends on how many people they have that use their service. &#x200B; At an average these services charge the restaurant 30% commission on an order. That means if you are ordering from a restaurant for 100 AED, they only receive 70 AED. Additionally the marketplace has become so discounted that there is an additional 20% that goes which means that the restaurant only received 50 AED. &#x200B; As the rule of thumb, the cost format of restaurants goes this way: 25% of their cost goes to food and packaging 25% goes to staff. 15% - 20% goes to rent 10% goes to Heat light and power. 10% goes to Government costs 5% goes into maintenance and upkeep That means at an average a restaurants makes 10% &#x200B; At an average now, 60% of the business comes in from aggregators. This means that they cannot cover costs which start to mount up. This means that out of 100 AED, they receive 70 AED when the costs are 90 AED. With covid 80% moved to delivery which means they received even less money. &#x200B; Additionally the money that used to come in to the restauranteur, is now held with the aggregators which means that the restaurant owner has no liquidity to pay off their landlords and suppliers. &#x200B; The restaurants that embraced tech that created their own digital platform for ordering have done better than most that are completely dependent on these aggregators. &#x200B; In short, If there is a restaurant that you love and want to see succeed, order from them directly. They need you more than you realize. Edit. WOW this blew up more than I expected. It's just think people should see all sides. ""]"

I have to get fresh for work in the morning, but I cannot wait to get this story out of my system. I've been tossing in my bed, thinking about the most amazing shawarma I had last night. I had the honour of eating the best shawarma in Dubai last night. I was starving, because I hadn't eaten any substantial amount of food for nearly 3 days. I found this nice little shawarma joint, in a very neat and quiet corner in Karama. As soon as I ordered for a shawarma, the Indian shawarma cook brandished his steel stick and meat sword, rubbing one against the other, sharpening the edge. It was surreal, watching and hearing someone else expertly wield and smash cutlery, almost giving it an ASMR feel. Hunger can be quite trippy, I guess. Anyways, this man ran up to me, while I was making a few custom adjustments to my shawarma, and tried to sell me some cheap ballpoint pens, but I told him no, I don't need a pen. I have plenty of pens lying on my desk at work. Does this man not understand basic supply and demand economics? So, I told the cook to put in extra mayonnaise, tahina and a little more chicken. He didn't look too pleased, but he did pop more of the stuff in, reluctantly. I told him to remove the tomatoes earlier, because I hate vegetables in general. Also, told him to our some of that spicy chilly sauce. Mhmm! Anyways, the street pen vendor is still around, and asks me to give him some money, if I didn't want to buy the pens, because he said he hadn't eaten in a week, and needed money to buy some food. As soon as cook hand delivered me some of the juiciest pieces of chicken in town, coated in spicy sauce, tahina and mayo (no veggies) wrapped in warmed Arabic bread, I rip the paper wrapper up, and engulf the top part of the shawarma with my salivating mouth. I proceed to utterly decimate the shawarma, while little scraps of chicken, sauce, spit and stuff flying out of my ravenous mouth hole. Time slowed down around me, as I look deep into the pen vendors eyes, claiming the shawarma to myself, establishing myself way up in the hierarchy to which all men are subject, poor or rich. He looked at me with a sense of a disappointment (and maybe a genuine concern for my wellbeing?), because in that moment, I was the lion who chased down, and mauled and killed a zebra on the Serengiti plains, whereas he was a mere hyena who could only cower and watch me chomp down on my kill, with its gnashing jaws working overtime. After downing the shawarma, and chasing it down with a can of Mountain Dew, and letting out a long, thunderous and satisfying burp, I paid the bill, and walked home, and collapsed on my bed, still reeling from the most shawargasmic experience of my life. Fellas, I think we all have to be grateful for all the blessings in our life, and never take anything for granted. I hope my experience reminds you to take what's yours, and win every day ever.

You’ve done exactly the right thing by letting her stew and feel the stress of the potential consequences but in my opinion that is punishment enough. Get a written apology and acceptance of the facts, drop the police case and forget this person ever came into your life. The guard is the main victim of the abuse (again, it is disgusting) but he’s decided to drop it. The employer of the guard and receptionist however have a duty of care though and if they respected their staff, that lady would be banned from the building. We all know that won’t happen though. With regards to the husband’s behaviour. People act stupid when they’re scared. This could bring their life down around their ears so cut him some slack. None of this means her actions should be without consequence but I’d suggest keeping her guessing about your decision will have been significant punishment already.']"

I was heading out to Al Qudra for a ride and took my usual exit to Shk. Mohammed bin Zayed road from Al Asayel st. This was around 8pm. While on top of the massive fly over bridge (previously referred to as ""Death roundabout"") I spotted what looked like a tiny kitten sitting on the side of the road. Pulled over into the emergency lane and stepped out to take a look. It was indeed a kitten that was probably abandoned. There was no way this tiny ball of fur could make its way to the top of a bridge. As I approached, the kitten got spooked and ran into the service tunnel. &#x200B; [Photo taken after 40 minutes on the bridge. RTA supervisor on site.]( I called the RTA emergency line and gave all of the details. Didn\'t know if they would respond or tell me that there is nothing they can do. To my surprise, around 40 minutes later, I get a call from an RTA team of 5 people saying that they are enroute and will try to help me out. &#x200B; [We went under the bridge to check if their 15m ladder could reach the tunnel. Unfortunately that wasn\'t the case.]( Their foreman (Naresh) then told me that he has called for an articulated crane and another 2 teams that will be blocking off one lane of the bridge. &#x200B; [Massive crane arrives on site.

Price is generally looking ok, but.... jesh. Any recommendations? We talk higher powered higher value non GCC spec car, BMW\'s (multiple). My main issues I have so far is: * The insurances I am offered do not cover ""agency repair"" after some years. This is nice, except for 2 things: One, I have no real intention letting some mechanic running on a 2019 BMW that he has likely only limited knowledge of. More... * The insurances I am offered instead have a list of garages they work together. This is nice in theory, but I am seriously wondering whether any of them is prepared to deal with a higher end and quite rare hybrid sports car. Hybrid in general require a lot of additional knowledge (suddenly car mechanic turns into high voltage specialist - there is a LOT of power in those 15kwh batteries) and in case of one of my cars I am sure that even opening the front hood without breaking it would be outside their knowledge. And being rare the chance they have seen one (it being involved in an accident) is astonishingly rare. Sports hybrids are rare and quite special and the idea of some run the mill garage doing the cheapest repair possible on something a finely tuned system like that gives me creeps. There seems to be no way to add agency repair to the policy regarding of age and/or to at least get the money and then have the repair done BMW with the insurance paying he original quote (worsts case, but seriously, in case of accident I want the best job possible). * I just read the conditions and welding, tightening OR CUTTING on the carrying parts of the car would automatically trigger a declaration of the car as being non-repairable. Now, I understand that for normal cars - you really do consider a car where someone had to remove the A column a salvage. The problem is that one of my cars has a modular glued carbon chassis. Carbon does not deform - it absorbs (a lot of energy), then breaks. Because this cannot be repaired, the chassis is modular and glued together and the idea is that you cut (with special tools at special places) the broken parts out and glue replacement parts in. So, I get it on the front left by another car, the carbon part breaks off and instead of replacing it as planned (and not that expensive) the whole car is suddenly automatically salvage. SERIOUSLY?

You might think that because you aren't buying a luxury car you aren't affected, but sadly it's those people who can least afford it who are.

In this post I will mention a detailed experience that I wish I knew before buying the car. This post will contain common-sense information for most people, but for people like me, it would be very useful. # Searching for a used car First of all, there are multiple places where you can find used cars, such as Dubizzle, Facebook Marketplace, and many other websites. My first thoughts were to buy a car from Automall as they tend to have mostly good reviews, but the problem was that they were hella overpriced. I know that they have a warranty, but it's REALLY overpriced. Second thought was to go to Harraj souq, but I have 0 experience in buying a new car so I was advised to stay away from Harraj. I started looking for Dubzzle within my price range and looking at multiple brands, I was filtering to see GCC cars only. But for my low budget I couldn't find but high-mileage cars so I looked at the most reliable cars such as Toyota and Honda. # After you find the car that you think is good, then what? 1. Ask the owner for VIN number ( chassis number ) and search if it has any previous accidents and there are multiple websites for that : ( I used the most ) 2. Ask the owner if he has any service records. They don't have to be from the official showroom, for example, the car that I was inspecting was regularly serviced by AutoPro ( ENOC ) so I called them and pulled all of the service records based on the VIN number provided and, as It turns out the previous owner have done all of the major serviced for the car a couple of months ago and he changed the oil regularly and the car was well maintained, so that's perfect. 3. After that, if the car is good and you liked it, ask the owner for a test drive and garage check The owner of the car that I found was located near Festival City in Dubai and I didn't want to drive too far for a garage, so I searched through Google Maps for the nearest garage with the highest reviews and planned to go there ( 4.5 rating with more than 1000 reviews ). I agreed with the owner and went to the place to test drive and I had a list of things that I should check in the interior and exterior as well. I also had a list of things I should pay attention to during the test drive and all was good. Then we went to the garage. They inspected the car well in an hour or so ( 150 AED charge ) and the report was clean as well beside some minor issue I managed to get a discount on. # Registration process 1. First of all the previous owner had an Abu Dhabi license plate, and I wanted to have the car with Dubai license plates so we went for Dubai Tasjeel at first but they told us that we should visit Sharjah or Abu Dhabi to make the ownership transfer, if the car that you are buying have the same Emirate you just go to Tasjeel and transfer the ownership, both of you should have your Emirates ID with your and car Mulkia. Skip the next part if the car is within the same emirate. 2. We went to Sharjah with the car, and we removed the plates and parked it in a special place nearby for cars without plates, and we went inside and waited for an hour or something, then we made the ownership transfer, which would cost around 550 AED and that's it. After that, you have to take the car to Dubai, but you can't drive it since that car doesn't have a number plate, so we had to take it with a recovery car ( there are lots of recovery cars there ) to take it to Dubai Tasjeel which costs around 120 AED. You have to take a taxi to get there as well ( 50 AED to the nearest Tasjeel in Dubai ) 3. ( TIME SAVING TIP ) Car insurance should be present before registering the car and you can't register the car without it, the center in Tasjeel is overpriced so you better call YallaCompare and send them a copy of the ownership certificate that you acquire and your driving license and Emirates ID and they will give you the best insurance offer, pick the best one for you ( cost me 1000 AED less than the center in Tasjeel and more premium insurance ) and pay online using your card and the insurance will be activated to your car within an hour ( while you finish the car inspection ). 4. Now you are in Dubai with the car with no license plate so while you are waiting for your insurance, you should queue for the inspection and in my case it was like 1 hour of waiting and they inspected the car and gave you the report, then you park the car and go inside the building. 5. ( TIME SAVING TIP ) Check if your car needs oil change or air filter change or tier change or any other service because they have Autopro there and you can change the oil there as well while you are making the registration inside ( Autopro might be overpriced but if your services are not big it won’t make that big of a difference ) 6. Inside the building, take your inspection result and queue for the registration. They are really fast, don't be afraid if you see a lot of people. After that they will check your insurance from their system which YallaCompare should confirm to you that your insurance is online and they will take the new ownership certificate from you and they will ask you if you want big or small number plate so you have to check with your car first and here you will pay registration fees which is around 420 AED. 6. After that you will take your vehicle license from another window and your new number plates as well, don't buy the plastic thing for the number plates unless your car needs it because they are expensive. 7. After that you should buy a new Salik card AND ACTIVATE IT through the app or website. You can buy it from there as well ( 100 AED ), comes with a 50 AED balance as well. 8. Go to your car and remove the old Salik sticker and put the new one and then you will find a guy that will put the new number plate on your car ( 30 AED ) Congratulations, you have now registered your first car in the UAE.""]"

Area of the apartment is around 842 sq. ft. Broker has shown the apartment and ask for this apartment is 360K AED Below are my high level calculations for this: 360K - Apartment cost 25K - additional (4% DLD + 2 brokrage and NOC++) I've some savings here and back home which is worth 150K and remaining 235K I am thinking to take on personal loan at 6.49% reducing interest rate (3.49% flat). I've done some research and met real people who are living there and asked their feedback too as per them it's heaven and the price I am getting is unbelievable and I should take it with closed eyes bla bla (This guy bought a 2 bhk 8 years back at 1.2 mn which is worth 500K as on today). I also heard about the high cooling charges there and ask a resident there about it and she gave me fundas on how can I reduce it by putting ceiling fans and even coolers 😂 Reason for choosing Skycourts 1. I am planning to stay there with my family. I am choosing this area as my kid got admission in Indian High School Garhoud so travelling for him will be quite easy. 2. I didn't found any 1 bhk property in Dubai which at this price (360K for 845 sq ft) with the amenities I saw there. 3. Seeing high rental yield. 1 BHk rent currently is 36K which is almost 10% gross rental yield and 6-6.6% net yield. 4. As per the title deed current owner bought the apartment at 455K in June 2020. (Not sure why Skycourts prices are falling below the 2020 crash prices whereas everywhere else is rising to new highs after the 2020 crash) Reason for choosing Personal loan over home loan. 1. Longer process, many different charges, floating interest rates. Whereas on personal loan I need pay only 1% processing fee other than the interest. I really need genuine feedback or advise from on ground people here (Not brokers please) whether Skycourts is a good Community and moreover good investment option to stay with family. If not for buying, will you recommend to stay at Skycourts on rental basis.

State and government-related real estate firms are looking to restart projects that failed in the wake of the city’s debt crunch during the global financial crisis. These include the mothballed man-made Palm Jebel Ali island and the stunted towers of Dubai Pearl, a long-delayed development at the entrance to another famous reclaimed island, Palm Jumeirah. These developments have long acted as visible reminders of past excesses but are now reviving thanks to a wave of new entrants to the city, from Asian billionaires and cryptocurrency investors to wealthy Russians looking to escape sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine. Dubai-based property consultants Mira Estate said sales to customers from Russia and the former Soviet states had doubled so far this year, compared to the same period in 2021. “Billionaires and entrepreneurs have been flocking to the UAE in record numbers, leading to a surge in demand for real estate,” said Tamara Getigezheva, Mira’s chief executive. “Most homebuyers are looking for ready units and waterfront properties.” The volume of transactions in Dubai’s residential market soared by a third in June 2022 compared to a year before. In the year to June, transactions reached their highest total recorded since the peak in 2009, according to real estate group CBRE. Donna Dickinson moves a peacock pool float as her 7-year-old son Elliot Dickinson jumps on a trampoline in the backyard of their home in Jebel Ali Village in Dubai © Jon Gambrell/AP “Off-plan” sales — of properties that have not been built yet — rose 47 per cent and ready homes by a quarter in the period. Prices increased by 10 per cent in the year to June, while average villa prices were up 19 per cent. Villas on Palm Jumeirah, the reclaimed island beloved by the city’s wealthy, recorded the highest average sales rate in the city, according to CBRE. It was developed by Nakheel, the government-owned firm that was at the heart of Dubai’s financial crisis in 2009 when it nearly defaulted on some of its debt. Demand for waterfront properties is providing a renaissance for the company, which was previously controlled by state conglomerate Dubai World and now falls under the emirate’s sovereign wealth fund, the Investment Corporation of Dubai. Palm Jebel Ali, which is one and a half* times larger than Palm Jumeirah, was put on hold in the aftermath of the 2009 crisis. Nakheel’s new management, once it receives government approval, is expected to launch developments on the island to meet demand for beachfront real estate, said three people briefed on the plans. Over the past few months, Nakheel has been contacting existing investors in the project and offering to buy back their contracts for plots and properties, said six people briefed on the offers. The company declined to comment. A monorail passes The Pointe on Palm Jumeirah in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Thursday February 24 2022 © Christopher Pike/Bloomberg Investors are being offered financial recompense or credit notes for other Nakheel properties, said three of these people. Customers will also be given the opportunity to reinvest their cash in the revived Palm Jebel Ali, they added. In such cases, the company would provide partial compensation as prices on the island are expected to be much higher than for the original project launched two decades ago. “I bought at a discount, but I don’t want to sell — I want the villa I bought,” said one Dubai businessman. Others who bought at a premium are facing poor recoveries on their investments if they sell back at the original selling price.""]"

Have good pictures - you doing something fun, a casual shirtless pic on the beach, maybe one with friends (not too many of those, the highlight is on you). Make sure these are well-lit pictures and show you well-groomed. 2. Take the cheapest premium plan (for a week or so) and then swipe like crazy. You get unlimited right swipes on Bumble Premium and this way you have a better probability (sorry but I love math) to have matches even after your Premium expires. Repeat the subscription when you’re having a dry patch again. This is good value. 3. Most matches expire because the women have to take the first step and trust me, they have a loooooong list to go through. So even if you have matches, only around 30-40% might convert to a chat. So when you get a chat request, don’t do the typical “how are you” stuff because every other guy is doing the same. Try the Question Game which makes things interesting, and also have a list of out of the box questions like “What’s your favorite city?” or “what kind of cuisine do you prefer?” 4. Dubai has a decent amount of women on Bumble but only around 30-40% will actively make plans, so don’t be disheartened if something doesn’t work out. Just move on to the next (that’s what they’re doing too). 5. On average there are 4 men on dating apps for every woman. This ratio might be even more skewed for Dubai. Remember, there are tons of wealthy and good looking (some combination I know) men in this city and the game is mostly about these two aspects. If you’re neither, you need to bring about some other quality in you that can catch the woman’s eye. Some women like humble, down-to-earth guys and loathe the show offs, and some are the opposite. So if you get rejected, pick it back up and move on. You’re an amazing man and you’ll be fine - hate the game and not the player 😊 Good luck and here’s to more matches bro 🍻🍻', 'Sorry, but there are a lot of stupid comments over here. Dear OP, and anyone else interested in knowing the reason, read this (from an Emirati): Elevators have many unspoken rules here, which stem from both, culture and religion. (Don’t say it’s 2023 and blabla. Culture is culture). 1- In less populated areas (not malls, so smaller areas with smaller elevators), if a family goes on, you don’t go with them, you take the next elevator. Entering with them, regardless of your color or nationality, is actually disrespectful to many. 2- Same case with a female or group of women, if you’re male, skip and wait for the next elevator. 3- In bigger elevators (like Dubai Mall etc.), let’s say a woman is in the bottom left corner, you take the opposite one, so top right corner. Another way, is having a “female side” and “male side” in the elevator if 2 families are inside. This was probably your case, and the guy wasn’t racist, he would’ve done it to anyone. Other guys who remain quiet probably have better anger management, but deep inside they’d like to push you off the elevator. (Again, regardless of your skin color or nationality). 4- Since locals are a minority percentage, some of them know that people might not understand this, so they’d have the wife on a corner, and they’d stand directly in front of her, as a “human partition”. Those who say “racism” please shut up, it’s not. I had the full traditional clothes once, and wanted to enter an elevator once because I was late for something important, there were ladies inside, there was a lot of space too but I didn’t enter, yet one of them told me “don’t even think of coming in” (half of them were with niqab too, so super conservative). And for those who said “it wouldn’t happen if OP is white”, few years ago I was in an elevator with my mom, and she grilled the hell out of a “white, blonde guy” because he entered the elevator and was a bit close to her. So…. This is the culture here, and this is the norm. If you don’t like it, it’s up to you, no one is seeking your approval. Just understand it, and abide by it with respect.', 'I’m sorry you’re dealing with this! But it’s definitely not all woman/men in Dubai and the UAE. I currently live in Abu Dhabi, and have been in a relationship the past year- but I’ve been in the UAE the last nine years(and used to live in Dubai for 4 of them so it’s not a Dubai vs Abu Dhabi thing). Personally I always offered to split the bill, and had no issues with a chill inexpensive date suggestion. I also sometimes would suggest the date place myself- and if I had a discount for it (ie entertainer bogof or a credit card perk etc) would always offer it up. Not bigging myself up at all though- I know every single one of my female friends here are the same, both in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. All of them like people for their traits ie humor, kindness, intelligence etc rather than for someone’s income, and lots of them, myself included, have dated men with much lower income than they make. That being said, there’s also been dates where the guy makes more money, and insists on paying, and that’s fine too- as the intention wasn’t a free date or making someone pay. I think do a bit of self- reflection to see if you’re putting something out there on the apps that is getting you into these situations, and if you are only going for a certain type of person aesthetically or personality wise. Also try to reflect on how the conversation is going- sometimes there are red flags, personally if I had to convince the person it was going to be fun, I probably wouldn’t want to go on a date with them anyways. Not saying this is your fault at all, so please don’t take the self reflection comments negatively! Just as someone who has definitely been there too with bad dates and feeling blue, I had a 4 year stint of terrible terrible dating, so understand sometimes there is bad luck and bad people out there. That being said, feeling sorry for myself or blaming others didn’t help, but once I analyzed the situation and myself more, and tried to put out a more authentic energy things ended up much better. Just saying this due to two of your comments- “if you try to show you’ve been doing well for yourself” I would personally hate this on a date, I don’t want someone to “show me” how well they’re doing, and then you also mentioned “if you act like a humble relatable Joe” insinuating you have to act humble. I don’t know you and it may be poor word choice, but that gives off the vibes to me that you’re not very genuinely humble and are very proud of your success (which is fine to be proud don’t get me wrong!!) and try to showcase your success, which may be coming across as braggy and attracting the wrong person or sending the wrong message. Some guys who like to show how we they’re doing enjoy spending it on their date, and get offended when the girl offers to pay- so there may be some of that learned experience on the girls part too. Anyways, very overly long response to say don’t worry, not everyone is like that here! Best of luck! You’ll find someone who doesn’t want to use you as a cash cow I’m sure :)']"

Those that develop symptoms mostly only have mild to bad ones (not much worse than a bad case of the flu). Also it seems kids seems particularly resistant to getting the virus or transmitting is. Old and sick people are the high risk groups and that\'s why you\'re seeing older generation being refused entry to malls and other crowded locations. That\'s not to say younger healthy people won\'t get the virus or die of it, but the % that do seems only slightly worse than a bad flu season not the apocalyptic predictions made in Jan/Feb this year.']"

The average spender thinks that by taking out a credit card they can protect themselves from unforeseen expenses, that's a slippery slope, because they've already made the number one mistake of living above their means. If you don't find ways to save early in life you'll find it difficult to adjust to when you are living margin to margin, month to month, on a credit card barely making payments as the interest accrue, just thinking about it gives me stress and anxiety. Just picture this, if you had to lose your job for whatever reason, would you rather lose your job with a credit card or without a credit card. Most people who lost their jobs are struggling with interest payments on basic expenses because they failed to face reality in time. Without a credit card reality is right at your door step at all times, there is not financial safety net you can escape reality with for a little while longer. I don't want to say credit cards are bad obviously, I'm sure they have excellent benefits, but from what I've noticed the privilege program cards only benefit the rich not the poor. Rich people use it to leverage their wealth and poor people use credit cards to survive, if you are young and a fresh graduate you may be somewhere closer to the poor end of the scale. I'm sure there are plenty of success stories of college kids with credit cards, but for the majority it's always been an imaginary license to spend free money, until it's not. I've never needed a credit card, never saw the pros in them only the potential pitfalls and there's never an easy way out of those once you find yourself trapped in one. If you still think you need a credit card as a backup, use it wisely. Consumer debt by design exploits the vulnerable. Good luck,"", ""Got scammed (Aed 28k) by a fake Al Baik website in Dubai (Help if possible to recover) Hi everyone. I got scammed by a fake Al baik food ordering website. It was a promotion on instagram (50% off). As soon a clicked it, it went to a link where we could order food. It seemed authentic at that time(but I realise now there were too many red flags). Once we give our credit card details, they ask for the OTP. But the OTP that is sent to you is for registering the card for mobile wallet usage (apparently thats Google pay). This was a huge mistake. I didn't go through it properly and entered the otp. But the transaction doesnt go through. Later after an hour or so. Money is charged to an offshore account very swiftly in 4-5 transactions. Mine was to a Ukraine account. I called the bank and immediately blocked the credit card and spoke to the fraud department. They gave me a dispute form to fill up and told me that resolution would take anywhere between 90 to 120 days. Since then i have been searching all over the internet about this scam. Do people get back the money from the bank? Most people who i speak to say No. Is there any possibility. I am really depressed with this.""]"

The reason is, the people I deal with on a daily basis in my line of work speak english in a very basic way, I have to talk like them in order to communicate properly. One time I decided to start talking to them in normal english, unfortunately it has failed as most of my instructions were not understood or misinterpreted, and they won’t tell me that they don’t understand my words so I come to know that after they screw up. Even sometimes I have to mix english with other languages to get my message through.

But now as I learn an European language having left the UAE, I am trying to figure out what went wrong. Two decades in UAE and barely any language fluency for me. People say the arabic education system for expats suck but I've seen first hand how it's the society which treats it as a burden. They treat it as if it cannot go together with their STEM subjects (especially Indians due to horrid rote system). Arabic is first to be neglected. My school teachers would actually bargain with my Arabic teacher for extra slots. The kids wouldn't listen to the teacher. The teacher I had was amazing but not only deprived of any ability to properly teach but severely undercut, you see the example I provided above. This is never the case with other countries. I see plenty of same kind of people go to Germany after studying German for 1 year. I am more or less in the same category. Ofcourse, Will Power is #1 and I have failed when it comes to Arabic. However, there needs to be something done more. English alternatives are overwhelming. It is extremely hard to get by in many European countries as a resident without knowing the language. I really loved the move in Dubai where some English Translations were replaced by Transliterations on road signs not so long ago. This was crazy enough for Jumeirah Janes to start going crazy on social media. This motivates people to learn. In Europe, They offer long term residencies which is a big motivator for the people. In the GCC, People don't get that long term incentive oe anything else. I've seen hundreds of people tell me they are gonna leave UAE in 2 years. 20...30 years later, they are still here. Other's who planned to live long, ended up losing jobs and packing up in 5. Amidst all this, I will always have a deep regret for missing out on Arabic. I hope I can learn it. Infact I think I know less Arabic now than I used to know as a kid when hanging out with arab kids, fighting with them and playing football in the streets 😂 Ironically, I have been using more Arabic in Europe than UAE when I talk in broken Arabic to a Syrian kid (refugee) who doesn't speak English. *TL: DR* Expats live for decades here, don't know arabic. This is a multi faceted complex problem which must be tackled. I believe every language is special. There is never a disadvantage when you learn a language. Arabic is too neglected for expats.

The point is there genuinely was healthcare stress and ATH death levels at the time and much lower population-level immunity, so being anti-mask then, while somewhat understandable given concerns about efficacy, was in fact just having a moan. Post-Omicron (and even during Omicron given how much more infectious but mild Omicron is) it's much, much harder to argue for a mandate of any sort from a public health perspective. And I disagree with the notion that politics drives any of the public health messaging here - we live in a monarchy that's actually blissfully unbothered by politics and optics around COVID for obvious reasons - it was true of other nations certainly.

I see the ""wear masks at all times"" signs but it feels like they\'re just for show. They\'re everywhere and not strictly enforced any more. Some places seem to not care about wearing a mask to the toilet, for example, or even just once you\'re inside period. Other places have staff members that seem to actively enjoy policing patrons and being over bearing at every possible moment. It puts everyone on automatic defense mode. So what is the situation? Will you still get closed down and fined? Could you be fired? I\'ve walked past police may times with a mask under my nose or half hanging off. No issues. But you see what I mean? Nothing is clear. I\'m not attacking you, it\'s likely above your paygrade. It\'s the owners and managers that don\'t want to appear giving out instructions to their customers, so they\'re cowards and letting you face the confusion.

You know i was not any graphic developer so I did not really care about how they added the assets. But I really wanted to get in on the action of copying games and selling since it was insanely profitable even at 10 aed a CD for a ps2 game. I remember specifically been offered this large block which basically had 5 slots of cds and multiple hdds just to store game files on. It was offered with ps2 firmware and Microsoft Xbox firmware installed on the device which you would then control using a software in your personal computer. But not PC games for some reason. I remember that costed around 3k aed. But since I was a teenage back then I did not have that kind of money. The same people that used to sell DreamBox devices used to also sell this device. Along side hacking routers and a bunch of stuff. God bless the liberal software market pre 2011. But regarding polygons and assets, while am not an expert, am 100% certain that back then assets were not desplayed on a dedicated developer program or something like that like the case with community built games nowadays. They were assets built by 3d softwares and imported manually using a combination of raw coding in whatever language the game is coded on and 3d editing software of the entire map. Fps played little role as graphics were not so demanding anyway and ran on the CPU only, so there was no need to specifically build the game in such a way where you need to take advantage of performance boosting methods like ensuring assets fit well together. As I said am not an expert but I did chill with alot of game developers at that time.""]"

Being a parent is the hardest job in earth and people love to readily offer unsolicited advice about what they should do with their kids (even though they have no kids of their own). Yes sometimes it is annoying, but cut the parents some slack. We really don't know what they are going through. If my son throws a tantrum because hey, he's 4 and that's the only way he knows how to process his emotions, I'm not going to get embarrassed and try to shut him up because it is making you uncomfortable, that being said, I won't just let him go on crying. It's a fine line we parents try to follow. The least people with no children can do is offer emotional support and just chill out. Obviously your post triggered a nerve and I'm not upset at you for having your views (or seeing some of the comments here) but I'm just saying it would be nice of people to be a bit more empathetic. That mother could have 2 hours of sleep for a week because the child is sick or the father could be going through something because the kids aren't doing well emotionally... If they aren't troubling you by getting in your way please just let it be. Stay safe and healthy OP and everyone. Parents out there, you're doing the best and don't let anyone make you feel bad for trying to take a few minutes for yourself."", '4 years of age is far too late in letting them vent and throw tantrums to process emotions. That happens 1.5 to max 3 years of age when they are developing no only their emotionally Awareness. Their manipulation tactics and their words and sentences to communicate. My son is now 2 years and picked up On how Throwing random fake cries and tantrums. Over little things to get attention or what he wants as an easier way out or Quicker. He started around 20 Months of age. When he does that and I just say firmly No. I don’t understand as you are crying. If he still cries. I say okay, I Will wait till you cry and then you can use your words to tell me what you need. If he still cries, I tell him I can wait longer or he needs to wait for his demand to be heard ( because it’s sometimes as silly as I want to do Something totally random In middle of lunch time or I want to Climb and jump On a sofa). You calm Then Down by letting them know this behaviour won’t work It’s better if they communicate. And if it’s something they need that’s not dangerous for them, they will have to wait Till the parents can give it to them. If their disagree they can go to their quiet corner or a time Out and process their emotions and then come back when they are calm. The first time he got louder. The second time even louder. The third time he cried for 2 seconds and then went quiet and started talking about something else. Distraction helps. Communication helps. And letting them Know their drama is just not an okay way to communicate not only Tells them how To Communicate but also who is the adult. Children who just learn to throw tantrums, or learn that parents will Give in or will Just let them cry forever, then loose the trust of an adult when they are actually hurt and needing attention. This is my Second child, the first one was even more difficult, her training started a little later because I was waiting for let her cry it out. Doesn’t help. They cry about everything and anything and louder every time. Did I let it wait till She was 4? No way. Saying this as a mother, yes parents with kids Do cut slack, parents with kids are also very well aware when a kid is crying or throwing tantrums versus just someone who is misbehaved throwing long tantrums because they won’t be stopped and are allowed to Do this. Please note that the other parents who might be around you or disapproving or unhappy, might have had a horrible Day at work, home or with own family and came Out to catch a break.

The fact is, oftentimes, parents will receive compassion for their children being snotty IF the parents are apologetic and actively try to discipline their children, rather than giving a ""kids!

I see kids being menaces and just assume they have crap parents. Lol, I\'m quite pleased you get a sense that I\'m not a parent, and I won\'t try to sway you in any direction regarding. One truly cannot compare having a child on a flight to having a child in a movie theater, your kid\'s being snotty in the movies? Walk them out, calm them down. Now what are you gonna do if the kid\'s acting up on a plane? I mean though, if your kid\'s on a plane kicking the seat in front of them, being loud and disruptive... surely, there must be something that can be done, and I imagine you can\'t walk them off the plane until they calm down. I also believe that children should be respected, just because I say parent your child, or discipline your child doesn\'t mean I don\'t think they should be treated with respect. I will not be parenting anyone\'s children, people take great offence to that. People can feel however they want to feel, as long as they know better than to act on it.

For the former, there is not much you can effectively/realistically accomplish, as opposed to the later situation. For kids making noise inside their closed apartment, viable options are to invest in some quality noise canceling earbuds or headphones as others have suggested (there are pro’s and con’s of each). For this situation, talking to the neighbors can be a high risk throw of the dice, and could backfire on you depending on the disposition of the parents and your demeanor as well if doing this (as others also pointed out). If the earbuds/headphones and trying to perform your work routine in a less noisy adjacent room (or some other innovative solution you may think of) does not work out, then you may need to consider moving. However this also has a risk of ending up in the same or similar situation. For the latter situation of noisy kids running around in the corridor, follow the sequence, nicely talk to neighbor, then security, then management company, as others have mentioned.

My friend who just went on her electric scooter to visit a grocery store on her way gets hit by an SUV; she was crossing the zebra cross while the Pedestrian signal was GREEN, and the signal for cars was RED! The driver slammed her across the street breaking her lower back and pelvis bone. The police came immediately for help and my friend was taken via an ambulance. The worst part is the aftermath; the driver who hit her never asked her how is she doing? If she needs any help with the treatment? Neither did the police came for any help except for a few meaningless phone calls. She has been paying her hospital bills and surgery bills (up to 80k AED) up until now merely with the help of her friends. Me and my friends have been trying to get help from the police, we have been trying to get her case reported in the police station. The police tells us that the case can only be filed once the patient has been discharged and we have complete reports of her including the bills. Needless to say this is getting so frustrating and my friend has been in the hospital for 10 days. She has completely lost her mobility, and probably can't work for 6 months to 1 year, her life is currently at halt, and she has no family of her own over here and friends can only do too much to help. Has anyone been through a similar incident? Please share your experiences as we are all rookies and the whole ordeal has been really tough on all of us. Any help would be great, thank you!"", 'My medical insurance didnt cover maternity at the time of my first pregnancy so I took the advice of med student and doctor friends and delivered my first kid at Latifa Hospital. I liked the pregnancy fitness classes offered by the hospital. I only met the dr at my last scheduled appointment. I read some “natural birth” books and wrote a birth plan, which I double-checked with my doctor friends. Coincidentally, Latifa Hospital had recently qualified for the UNWHO’s Baby-Friendly Hospital status so there were a lot of policy and procedure changes that I benefited from. I liked that it was a midwife-led team in the labour and delivery ward, and that the staff were so quick to respond with empathy when I showed basic courtesy and kindness. I absolutely loved the breastfeeding support team at Latifa: they’re amazing educators. Around the time of my second pregnancy I discovered that a work friend’s sister was an ob-gyn at Latifa, and I experienced “pregnancy/ delivery/ postnatal care” wasta during my pregnancies with second and third kids. A “perk” about delivering at Latifa Hospital was that my husband could apply for the birth certificate at the special office inside Latifa Hospital (rather than trekking it to Baraha Hospital in Deira or paying a small fortune to a third-party service provider like Baby Steps). A further perk was that my babies were eligible for priority access to Latifa Hospital’s AWESOME (and very low-cost) newborn intensive care (which I needed for one of my children) and free childhood vaccinations (apart from chicken-pox and rotavirus and one other, that required extra payment) at my nearest health care center. Personally I’m a Muslim and I appreciated that my child’s religious needs at birth were going to be recognized and prioritized at Latifa. It didn’t bother me that I’m a different race than many doctors/ staff at Latifa, although I did have a (bizarre) conversation with another doctor during my third pregnancy where I had to specifically tell her that I was born in a certain Eastern country, yet spent my childhood in a specific Western country with lots of clean air/ healthy exercise/ nutritious diet, to convince her to significantly alter my treatment plan.', 'As there is no death resulted from this accident, police will treat this case just like any other Traffic Accident. The SUV driver will be issued a fine for his mistake, whereas the person who got hit will be transferred to a hospital **where his/her insurance company will take care of all the bills**. The last part is very important here, because if the person involved does not have a valid health insurance, well then (s)he must have deep pockets. Once the person in hospital recovers, you can proceed to file a separate police complaint against the driver of the SUV, which will essentially be a damages claim. After preliminary investigation by the Police (for that particular case), it will be forwarded to Court where you basically have to follow it as a Civil Law Suit. This is where you lawyer up and wait for the final verdict. (The SUV driver may or may not be held in jail during the course of this trial). Once you receive the verdict, the court will announce the penalty amount to be paid by the SUV Driver, whereby the latter can also proceed to challenge the decision for a reduced penalty. I can understand your emotions, and do not want to comment on the actual causes which may have led to the incident. But you must understand that legal and emotional do not mix together. If the hit and run results in the death of one of more persons, well ... then the sh\\*t just gets real for the offender, where he will have to bear a jail term as well as pay the blood money as ordered by courts. P.S. A note to all pedestrians. You must always make sure the way is clear before you move forward EVEN IF you have a right of way. Something which very few pedestrians actually do, and then say stupid sh\\*t like ""the other party should stop because my way is green"".

Since the start of time it has been so that there is only a male and female companionship.

I stay in a big apartment complex and we have a rotation of security guards, I’ve been in this complex a while and know most of the guards (majority of whom are of African nationality). Anyway, Karen steps out of the lift and goes to talk to the reception. Karen’s daughter runs off and out of the building. I’m about to tell Karen that her daughter is out of the building when I see Karen’s daughter rushing to the road where cars are going super fast. The security guard on duty jumps out, grabs Karen’s daughter and pulls her back from the road and then brings her back to the building. I witnessed the whole thing. Karen comes running out of the building and starts SCREAMING that the security guard is a pedophile and how dare he touch her daughter like that? She starts saying all sorts of shit, accusing him of being a rapist and threatening to have him hung, drawn and quartered. The poor security guard looks like he wants to curl up and die. I stepped in and told Karen what actually happened and the security guard probably saved Karen’s daughter. Karen then rounds on me (I’m South Asian) and starts claiming that I’m in league with the security guard and accuses me of being a pedophile too. The receptionist comes out (a Filipina) and Karen screams she wants to speak to someone in-charge! She yells that she wants me and the security guard off the property immediately as we are pedophiles eyeing her daughter. At this point, I lost my temper and called the police. Karen kept screaming at us and told me, “go ahead, call the police!” Police eventually show up and the first thing they do is look at CCTV footage where it is totally clear that the security guard saved Karen’s daughter. I gave a statement to the police about all the awful things Karen was screaming about me and the security guard. Through the CCTV footage they can see Karen yelling, but can’t hear the words. Once Karen saw the footage, she got very quiet and then denied that she ever said any of those things. Thankfully, the receptionist took a recording halfway through Karen’s rant and you can clearly hear all the awful things she was saying. Then Karen totally changed her tune and started crying saying that seeing her daughter in danger she lost her mind and started apologising. I told the security guard he would be well within his rights to file a complaint. I certainly told Karen that I told the police in my statement that I want to file a complaint against her for defamation and anything else the police come up with. She cried harder and the police officer encouraged me to settle the matter and the security guard caved and dropped the matter. I said I’d think about it. This all happened about a week ago. A day or so after the incident, I went to the police and filed a complaint for defamation and harassment. I guess Karen got a notification about it and she came to my apartment. She asked to come in, but I didn’t trust her to claim something untoward happened because we were alone inside, so I said I didn’t want to speak to her alone and she should speak to the police and I shut the door. She started yelling that I needed to take back the complaint and banging on my door and I called security who eventually led her away. My neighbour in the apartment next door is witness to this entire scene. But then her husband came by and he explained that she’s under a lot of stress after she lost both her parents to covid during the pandemic. He also begged me to drop the complaint. Even the police is recommending I settle. Should I settle and drop the case? UPDATE #1 Her husband just came knocking again. I told him it’s 3AM and I have work tomorrow. He apologised but said that they cannot sleep because they’re so stressed because of the police complaint and they truly want to settle this and she’s very sorry. I asked him if he and his wife have apologised to the security guard and thanked him for saving their daughter? He didn’t say anything which I interpreted as a no. I told him not to come by my flat again and that I have no intention to settle. Whether she gets fined, deported or imprisoned, she deserves it for being a racist. He then started crying and saying they’re good people and his wife is not a racist, she’s made a mistake and he has no words to justify it but she’s not been the same since her parents died and he doesn’t know how to fix it. I basically herded him out of my flat and closed the door. Crazy effing shit. But now I feel really bad. UPDATE #2 Thanks everyone for your kind words and support. I thought a lot about what to do today and decided to go ahead with the complaint for now. A good friend of mine is a criminal lawyer and I called him and explained the whole thing. He’s agreed to take on the case at cost. He’s added more complaints for assault and intimidation. He’s also told the police not to contact me, but only him. This way the police can’t pressure me to settle. I also had another friend help me install a new camera near my door so I have evidence if they come back again. I spoke to the landlord’s office because I wanted permission to install the camera. The landlord’s company president called me. Once I told him my claim is going ahead, he said he will give me permission to install the camera. He also assured me that if I wanted, they would evict Karen and her family (apparently what she’s done with me wasn’t her first incident. She’s had issues with the landlord staff and has verbally insulted building cleaners and gardeners and tried to get people fired). I told the landlord can do whatever they want, but I don’t want to be the cause of someone losing their home. So I’m not sure if the landlord will go on to evict, but with the complaints against her and now a criminal case, the landlord may have cause. Lastly I spoke to my lawyer tonight who said that in most cases, there’s only a fine. But in most cases all that happens is someone uses abusive language or shows the middle finger. In this case, it was constant abuse and then she lied and came to my home and tried to intimidate me. There’s a strong chance here she might get some (a month max) of jail time. But that is up to the judge. In the meantime, she can’t travel and is stuck in the country until the case is resolved. I spoke to the security guard today and told him that if he changed his mind and wanted to file a complaint, I would support him and pay for my lawyer to represent his case. But he still didn’t want to go down that path, which is fine. I also thanked him for his bravery since he likely saved Karen’s daughter’s life and deserves to be praised. And that’s that. Now there’s nothing more for me to do but wait. It may take several months, but it doesn’t affect me. Thank you to everyone again! This Karen is going to get her comeuppance!']"

However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Hair loss can be influenced by various factors such as genetics, hormonal changes, nutritional deficiencies, stress, and certain medical conditions. Washing your hair with water in Dubai on a daily basis is unlikely to cause any significant damage or hair loss. It is essential to maintain good hair hygiene by keeping your scalp clean and free from excess oil and dirt. If you have concerns about the water quality, you can consider using a mild shampoo and conditioner or using filtered water for washing your hair. To promote healthy hair, you can also incorporate other hair care practices such as using a conditioner, avoiding excessive heat styling, protecting your hair from the sun, maintaining a balanced diet, and keeping your scalp hydrated. If you experience excessive hair loss or any other concerns about your hair, it is advisable to consult a dermatologist or a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice and address your specific needs.', 'Yeah, that’s definitely not true. If you want check out some studies, water is different in different areas places. If you’re from a country where the natural tap water comes from the mountains and compare to the water in Dubai, one is obviously different than the other. The water here does not cause hair loss - it causes dryness because it’s a harder type of water, which can cause your hair to lose strength and fall easily. You put a filter showerhead which cleanses the water and makes it softer, therefore not drying out your hair, not regrowing it… If you’re not convinced, ask yourself why is there a whole business around filtering the water, when there isn’t in other countries? Cause it’s pointless to sell it in countries with good water. To people who are born here or have lived here for a long period, the hair has adjusted, but to people who have lived elsewhere and come here it’s not the case. It’s the same in the UK with the water, but still water isn’t as hard as here.']"

Had a couple in the days to come, while on holiday. Then, had 1 a week. Then 1 every two weeks. Now, 1-2 every year. I can live with that. For me, quitting was not about willpower, or patches or gum (which tastes dreadful, by the way). It was about quitting what made me smoke: in this case, the stressful job. I'm quit for periods of time all sorts of things in my life - sugar, alcohol, caffeine, and I can say that quitting smoking is the only thing that's made a **real** difference to my life. Huge difference to my energy levels, mood, fitness, (on the other hand, so did quitting 12-hour-shift work). On the downside, massive difference to my appetite, too. I know why models smoke. When I quit smoking I wanted to absolutely chow down on loads of chips and rice, and carbs overall. It was a nuisance having to order so much extra food."", ""I understand you bro. I started dhoka during uni when i was 19. I personally feel dhoka is as bad as the drugs mentioned before, took me years to get off the hook. Everytime i tried to quit i somehow winded up back to it maybe after a week, month or year. The way to beat dhoka is to switch to vape or lesser harmful alternatives or cut ties with smoking crowd or go for a vacation with no chance of getting dhoka. Once you get clean you'll start experiencing true joy, peace of mind and confidence. But Quitting dhoka is the first stage, the tougher battle is later when you think you beat it. You'll feel tempted at times to smoke one more time for the nostalgic value and since you're confident you wont be addicted, you'll try it.. Thats how it starts all over again. Know this - you can never truly get over addiction, it'll always be there in you at some level..

First 3 days was the most difficult time but now I am confident to pull through. My advise to those who are not addicted to smoke please do not even think of trying it for once even if your friends forces you. Edit: Thank you guys for all your support.

Bad english, bad grammar, etc is ""sadly"" expected when there are so much diversity and english often is 2nd or 3rd language. However using inappropriate words like Dear, etc... is not so ok.

Calling strangers Dear is either very flirtatious or condescending. (Or you are talking to a very old person).

In “Dear Mr. Walken,” Dear is being used as a salutation that is a more formal version of the “To” or “Hello.” In the case that I believe OP is describing, “dear” is being used as a nickname or otherwise informal replacement in a sentence where a person’s name should be. For example, in “Please, would you pass me the salt, dear?” the word dear is being used where the person’s name could be (“Please, would you pass me the salt, Abdullah?”). In some cultural contexts (mine included), the first use as a salutation is very polite, formal, and respectful while the second use is insulting, condescending, and offensive (unless, as others have pointed out, it is your very old grandmother saying it). Does that make sense and explain why you were taught in the course to start emails and letters with “Dear Mr. X”? Two completely different uses of the word in the same way that the word “sweet” could be used to describe something that tastes sugary OR something that someone else does that is kind or thoughtful. (That all being said, even though the second use of “dear” also is so abrasive to my ears, I try to remember exactly what others in this thread have said. Usually here in the UAE it is being used as a term of respect, and I do not have ownership over the word and how others use it even though my cultural background does not equate it with respect. When someone calls me dear, I smile and appreciate that they are going out of their way to communicate with me in my native language and simultaneously show respect to me.)', 'Hi, yes emails do start with Dear, however that’s completely genuine and understandable and this is how emails should start.

The labourers being exploited and slave labour is a 2000-2012 narrative. After that period, the labourers know what they are singing up for. During the early 2000s there were ""manpower supplies"" companies that had recruiting agents in various countries, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines and even North Korea. These companies would make false promises and take loads of money upfront, guaranteeing people various jobs in well placed companies and trap them into working for measly wages as these people were burdened with loans they took in the first place to get the job. Today, this is a very well known scam - people from the countries mentioned above have enough horror stories from their neighbours/friends/relatives/townsfolks to understand not.to fall for it, not to mention government awareness programs at a grass root level. Therefore, these labourers come from a background where they are grateful to be employed and to be able to provide the basic necessities to their families back home, as their families are literally starving to death on the streets or homes that are barely holding themselves up. They\'re a slave to their destiny. The destiny which was not created just by the Gods but by their chosen leaders of their country. Let\'s take India, since I know that the best - farmer suicides, I\'m sure you\'ve heard of that - it\'s the same farmers family members that have decided to come here and work as labourers so that their families can have at least ONE meal a day. Your garbage is literally their luxury. Nepal - the massive earthquake, can\'t remember around 2014 or something, that\'s another cause for cheap labour. Nigeria, Bangladesh, Pakistan poverty and starvation is rampant enough that a AED 900 , accomodation and three meals a day is better than nothing. Now, why cheap labour? government contracts and China. China as a country can put it\'s human resource capital might behind construction projects. That\'s human capital exploitation on mammoth scales. They underbid for almost all construction projects and can manipulate the pre qualifications. Nobody can question China. So to keep up other companies need to compete and that\'s driving the market to not consider the labourers situation. War, civil war and unrest caused by multiple political factors. It\'s quiet simple really, if you don\'t have money, you\'re f***d. Everybody is just trying to make the best out of their situations. It\'s as simple as that. The best solution, be kind to them when you can. The top post here, I saw someone mention Smart Life, it\'s an excellent organization. Do your bit. That\'s about it.']"
